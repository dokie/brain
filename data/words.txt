Rachel held herself tightly and rehashed all the bitter memories.
The water soaked into her skin and she wished the gentle lapping would wash away her regrets and better-left-unsaids.
Yet her mood only darkened as the wrinkles formed.
She blamed herself for everything.
For the aborted pregnancy, for the bruises on her cheek and back, for the bitterness that forever clung to her.
The alternative was too overwhelming, that the world is full of assholes, or that happiness is difficult to acquire and nearly impossible to hold on to.
Sheâ€™d rather take the responsibility. At least then there is hope.
