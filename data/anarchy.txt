         Introduction:

                   Touched off by the discussion on Ripco <312>-528-5020, I
 found many users asking questions about police radar, radar detectors, and
 speeding.  With Ron Majors talking about the oil spill that will appear in
 detail on the news at ten I thought a informative file on the subject might
 be beneficial.  I myself had my first experience with police radar in my
 fathers car, then following in baseball and my own driving, much more on the
 subject.  What a fascinating device, that it will return your speed instantly,
 what fun one would be to have!  After a quick talk with a police friend of
 mine, I soon took possession of a used police radar gun.

         Part one: Operation.

                   Police Radar works via the doppler effect, best
 demonstrated by sound rather than microwaves.  The doppler effect is the 
 relation of speed to the pitch of 'sound'.  Sometime, all of you must have
 had the distinct pleasure of being honked at by a motorist on the go, 
 you might have noticed that the horn <an F flat on most american cars> 
 begins with a higher pitch and as the car passes, drowns off to a lower
 tone.  The sound waves at the front of the car are pressed together by the 
 forward motion of the car, creating a higher pitch.  As the car passes,
 the tone dies off to a lower pitch because the waves are spread out.
 Police radar works in much the same way.  The major differences are the
 frequency and the concentration of the carrier.
                   As of 1988, the F.C.C. is rumored to have lifted restrictions
 on police radar frequencies.  Before, only two frequencies were approved for 
 police radar use.  X-band <10.525 GHz> which is most commonly used, and 
 K-band <24.15 Ghz>.  I will assume for now, due to lack of any SOLID evidence
 supporting the restriction lift, that those are the only two in operation.
 Police radar 'beams' are similar in shape to a flashlight beam.  They begin
 with a thin width and cone outwards with distance. Most guns operating at 
 the X-band level have a range of about 2000 ft., although high power units
 can exceed 2500 and 3000ft., and K-band guns fall shorter at about 1200 ft..
 At 1500ft., the radar beam becomes about the width of four highway lanes, so
 for practical purposes radars range is around 1700 ft..  A radar signal
 transmitted from the 'Radar Gun's' transmitter, (called the oscillator) will
 bounce off a object and return to the radar receiver (or antenna).  If the
 object is moving, the frequency of the beam will be altered as it bounces.
 This is most easily visualized watching water ripples.  Assume now that I
 have just dropped a pebble in a pond, and the ripples are moving outward,
 assume also for purposes of simplicity that the ripples are moving at
 1 foot per second, and that they are one foot apart.  The ripples are 
 therefore also one second apart.  Upon bouncing off a stationary object
 the ripples will return weakened, but at the same interval and speed 
 <Not really the same speed, but let's not complicate things>.  Now let
 us assume that a toy boat is traveling in the water at .5 ft. per second,
 1/2 the speed of the ripples, away from the point which I dropped the 
 pebble.  Assume the first ripple has hit the boat and is traveling back.
 The second ripple now traveling at 1 foot per second is only gaining on the
 boat by .5 feet per second <1 ft. per second - .5 ft. per second>.  This means
 that the ripple is one foot away from the boat, as the ripples are one foot
 apart.  The ripple will take 2 second to reach the boat, as the closure speed
 is .5 ft. per second and the distance is 1 foot.  The ripple strikes the boat
 and bounces back two seconds after the first ripple.  The process works 
 inversely for an object moving towards the pebbles point of impact.  
 As the distance between the ripples can be determined by the speed, on the
 other side, the speed can be determined by the distance between the ripples.
 Police radar works in the same way with microwaves.  The microwave signal
 bounces off a moving vehicle and returns altered in frequency.  In this way
 the radar unit determines the speed of the object.  Radar is only accurate
 when the object is moving directly at, or directly away from the gun,
 although some modern guns will account for this 'COSINE error', most won't.
 Cosine error can be defined as this:  When a radar signal bounces off an
 object at an angle from the objects direction of travel it will return a
 portion of the objects speed computed by the cosine of the infraction
 angle.  If the angle of the objects direction and the radars direction is
 20 degrees the speed returned by the radar is 93.97% of the objects
 actual speed.  cos (20) = .93969262 * objects speed = returned speed.
 For example:  A car is traveling at 75 m.p.h..  The state trooper, in his
 infinite wisdom, decides to "Clock" the automobile in hopes of meeting his
 quota for the month. Picking up his handy radar gun, he aims, and fires
 an invisible beam of microwave energy.  The officer however, being the rookie
 he is, leaves a high angle between the cars direction and his beam of 45
 degrees.  Cos (45) = .707106781  .707106781 * 75m.p.h. = 53.03300859 
 53 m.p.h. is displayed on the officers screen.  Lucky motorist.
 Sorry 40 column users.

         Part 2: Application

                   In 1986, over 15 million speeding tickets were issued,
and experts estimate that over 25% of them were in error.  Police have
been using radar for speed control for many years, and as the technology
has become more complex and accurate, so has the ability to get away with
the slight infractions of the speed limits set by the government become more
difficult.  In recent years, the three most damaging advances to motorists
in radar technology include:  A> Instant on radar.  B> K-band radar. and
C> Cosine error correcting radar units.


                   Instant on radar.
                             With the increase of radar receivers, or
"Detectors" on the roads, police have attempted to bypass the motorists
first line of defense.  The most damaging advance in the war against speeding
motorists is instant on radar.  The idea behind instant on radar is to make
the radar detector useless to the motorist by making his warning too late to
react to.  Instant on radar was developed in early 1983, but never marketed 
until late 1984 when the michigan state troopers were equipped with the first
instant on radar guns.  It operates by deactivating the oscillator until 
triggered by the officer.  When used properly and under the right traffic
conditions, it is indefensible.  It works like a camera, the officer
operating the radar will position himself behind a blind corner or over a
hill.  When the approaching car crests the hill or rounds the corner, the
officer will activate the oscillator, taking a "snapshot" of your car.
As microwaves travel at the speed of light, any attempt at slowing down
is futile, the officer behind the gun has your speed in less than a tenth
of a second.

                   K-band Radar.
                             When radar detectors were first marketed by
the markers of ESCORT, there was only one type of radar.  X-band.
In an attempt to increase the dwindling speeding ticket revenue, K-band 
was brought to life.  K-band is a different frequency that could not be
picked up by the primitive detectors of the age.  However, as the 
frequency got out, the detectors adapted, and now any detector worth a dollar
will detect both X and K bands.  K band is more dangerous as most K-band
guns are instant on and they have less 'Splash' and range than X-band guns.
This means that a K-band signal is probably closer to you.

                   Cosine error correcting guns.

                             Cosine error was a major falling of radar
in the judicial system, all readings were under question in court, the
result was a gun which will correct for cosine error by determining the
angle which the radar beam "impacts" with the car.  Also new in correcting cosine error were guns with 'Speed lock on' in which the highest speed reading
received by the gun is locked in and displayed.


                    Moving radar guns.
                             
                             Until new developments, all radar units
had to remain stationary as radar measures only closure speed, and not actual
speed.  Moving radar ended this trend.  Moving radar works like this.  First the radar gun determines the patrol cars speed by clocking a sign or fixed
object.  The closing speed of the patrol car to the sign is subtracted from
the now taken closing speed to the target car.
                             Patrols speed - 60 m.p.h.
                             Closing speed to car - 120 m.p.h.
                             120 m.p.h. - 60 m.p.h. = 60 m.p.h..


         Part 3: Defense
                   From the dawn of speed enforcement, motorists have sought
to defeat the laws, starting with detectors, continuing to jammers and
topping out with the new 'CHiPs detectors'  The unfortunate conditions
now favor the police and law enforcement officials with the introduction
of new radar technologies such as instant on radar.

                  Detectors:

                          The simple radar receiver is the first line of
defense from radar.  Varied in operation and features, the radar detectors
of today are designed to provide high sensitivity and low rates of false
alarms.  Good detectors will measure signal strength and type <K or X>
and have an effective range of about 3000 ft. and a probable range of well
over a mile.  Sensitivity tops out around 110.5 dBm/cm^2 for X band and
108 dBm/cm^2 for K band <Both set by the passport>.  A detector can give
you an excellent advantage over radar by alerting you it's there.  Detectors
become especially useful in chicago where instant on radar is not typically
used.
                   Jammers:
                             Radar jammers are essentially units that
transmit microwaves at a frequency dictating a certain speed.  The result is
regardless of your speed, the police radar unit will display the speed you
set the jammer to transmit.  Jammers are highly illegal and will be
confiscated if discovered, expect a stiff fine.
                   
                   Chip's detector.

                             This is a new device, which is really a scanner
on the police radio band.  It takes advantage of a signal transmitted by the
patrol cars in some states as part of their dispatch system.  The signal 
carries for about three miles, and the Chip's Detector will alert you if you
are within that range of a highway patrol unit.  It also allows scanning
of police radio channels.

         Last words.

                   Radar is a basically accurate instrument, when used
properly, it can be deadly.  As I have said before instant on radar is
impossible to avoid when there is no other traffic around, regardless of
a detector.  The only thing that comes close is a Radar Jammer, which 
will most likely not serve you well unless it is WELL hidden.  Radar
jammers are dangerous with the introduction of the HAWK, a radar unit by
Kustom Signals, which DETECTS radar jammers in the hold mode.
                   Aside from radar, VASCAR
                  <Visual average speed computer and recorder>
                   is a new danger to motorists.  It is basically a stopwatch
used to time your movement between two point of which the interval distance
is known.  Using the formula    Average velocity = distance / time, the state
trooper can determine your speed without setting off your detector.
                   Instant on radar defense.

                             The only real defense for instant on radar
is traffic.  Traffic will cause the trooper to activate his radar gun more
often, cluing you into his presence.   A jammer well hidden will help,
but the best technique is to follow a car making good time.  Any police
units in the area will clock him first, and legally they have to ticket him,
unless you're too close.


Remember: 
    Do not speed, it is a dangerous practice, and I can not be responsible
    for any injury, or action due to this file, it is for informational
    purposes only.  The state troopers enforce speed limits for your
    safety.

                   Radar guns: Models.

                             Radar guns are manufactured by many different
companies, but the primary ones are Kustom Signals, M.p.h. Industries, and Decatur.
                             The deadliest gun now available is the HAWK
manufactured by Kustom Signals.  It is the first gun capable of clocking
cars moving the SAME direction as the patrol car.  It has two antennas, one 
forward, and one back.  Like I stated before, it is also the first gun capable
of detecting radar jammers.  These run about 2000$

                             Kr-11
                             This gun is a two piece model which uses
a weak pulse signal in the moving mode to determine the patrol car's speed 
while not triggering detectors.  This gun permits a faster clocking time for 
instant on moving radar, it runs about $1200

                             Falcon
                             This is a hand held gun operating on K band
Small and compact it is preferred among law enforcement radars. It runs about
600$

                             Hr-4 Hr-8 Hr-12
                             400,500,750$ respectively, these are hand
held radar guns made by Kustom Signals

                             All these units are available to you via me
for less than the troopers pay for them.  For prices, and statistics, 
call my board at (312) - 787 - 2174 or send me mail at Ripco (312) 528-5020

                             Prices for radar units range from 250-2000$
                             I personally enjoy harassing that 911
                             who barrels by at 95 with a detector.

     Ok, so ya say ya wanna learn how to pick combination locks...This text 
file should help you. As a matter of fact, if ya do it right, it will help 
you.  First of all, let me tell you about the set-up of a lock.  When the lock
is locked, there is a curved piece of metal wedged inside the little notch 
on the horseshoe shaped bar that is pushed in to the lock when you lock it.
To free this wedge, you must(must is a word used to much) you usually(that 
sounds much better) have to turn the lock to the desired combination and the
pressure on the wedge is released therefore letting the lock open.  I will now
tell you how to make a pick so you can open a lock without having to waste
all that time turning the combination (this also helps when ya don't know the 
combination to begin with).  First of all, ya need to find a hairpin. What's a 
hairpin?  Well, just ask your mom.  She will have one.  If she asks what its 
for, say ya gotta hold something together...  If she says use a rubberband or
use a paperclip, tell her to fuck off and die and then go to the store and rip
off a box of 50 or so.  Ok, enough stalling (yea, i was stalling).  Once you
have your hair pin (make sure its metal), take the ridged side and break it off
right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight side.  The curved part
t can now be used as a handle.  Now, using a file, file down the other end 
until it is fairly thin.  You should do this to many hairpins and file them
so they are of different thicknesses so you can pick various locks.  Some locks
are so cheap that ya don't even have ta file!  But most are not.  Ok, now you 
have a lock pick.  Now if ya haven't figured it out, here's how ya use it.  
You look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from.  If you can't tell,
you will just have to try both sides.  When ya find out what side it opens from,
, take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of the horseshoe-
shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.  Now, put pressure on the 
handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the crack) and pull the lock up and 
down. The lock will then open because the pick separated the wedge and the 
notch allowing us thieves to open it.  Don't say bullshit until you've tried it.
Because I have gotten lots of beer money from doin' this to fellow students' 
gym lockers.  Also, this technique works best on American locks.  I have never
picked a Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the wedge but
if anyone does it, let me know how long it took.  Also, the Master lock casing
is very tight so ya can't get the pick in.  So, if you're locking something
valuable up, use a Master, cuz at least ya know I won't be picking it and I'm
sure there aren't that many that could.  And when I say pick, i don't mean 
lighting a stick of dynamite next to the lock, picking is opening a lock without
t using force, making a substitute key, etc...  If any of you believe that this
information is not sufficient for picking an American lock, or any other kind besides Master, leave me a message at /\/\etallant 1 (503) 538-0761.  
     This concludes my text file on picking combination locks.  My next text file will probably be "Picking key locks".  See ya later.

                           How to Pick Master Locks 
By Gin Fizz & Ninja NYC 
 
    Have you ever tried to impress your friends by picking one of those Master 
combination locks and failed? Well then read on. The Master lock company has 
made this kind of lock with a protection scheme. If you pull the handle of it 
hard, the knob won't turn. That was their biggest mistake...... Ok, now on to 
it. 
 
    1st number.  Get out any of the Master locks so you know what's going on. 
1: The handle part (the part that springs open when you get the combination), 
pull on it, but not enough so that the knob won't move. 2: While pulling on it 
turn the knob to the left until it won't move any more. Then add 5 to this 
number. Congradulations, you now have the 1st number. 
 
    2nd number. (a lot tougher) Ok, spin the dial around a couple of times, 
then go to the 1st number you got, then turn it to the right, bypassing the 1st 
number once. WHEN you have bypassed. Start pulling the handle and turning it. 
It will eventually fall into the groove and lock. While in the groove pull on 
it and turn the knob. If it is loose go to the next groove; if it's stiff you 
got the second number. 
 
    3rd number: After getting the 2nd, spin the dial, then enter the 2 numbers, 
then after the 2nd, go to the right and at all the numbers pull on it. The lock 
will eventually open if you did it right. If can't do it the first time, be 
patient, it takes time. 
 
 Have phun...

|  StunGun: Deffensive and Offensive   |
|  Strategies; Mods to kit; 10/3/86    |
+--------------------------------------+

        Need a weapon, but don't want to hassle the registration, or worry
about being caught possesing 1?  Then there is now the StunGun[s/g]...it is
legal in most states.

        Actually, the s/g is based on the TaserGun, that the cops now use to
subdue violent offenders.  The s/g is a modification the the kit u buy.
The kit has 2 prongs that u must actually push into the victum-which is stupid
and risky for 3 reasons:

  1) the attacker may mistake the s/g as a weapon and shooot u dead right there
     when u try to pull it out
  2) the attacker may shoot u as u try to stab him with the electrodes
  3) there may be more than 1 attacker

        The modification disguises it as a shity-old flashLight so he will
think nothing of it as you zap him.  Take an old beat-up medium sized flash
light about 6 inches long...it has to be long enuf 2 house the p_c board,
dart gun mechanism, flashLight battery etc...now, mount  the p_c board into
the back part, leaving nuf room for dart-gun mech...be sure to fan-fold the
electrod wire so when the dart fires, it will lead nice and smooth, and fast.
U might want to put in a powerful BB-gun type air-powered projecter to make
sure the electrodes penetrate a thick leather jacket.  If you are really
mechanicaly oriented, U would best to make it reatractable, so u can zap
1 attacker, stun him for a sec, retract the elect., then zap the others...

Strategies:

1) it would be best if u make the s/g still shine a light-to keep the disgise-
and to avoid suspicion.
2) test the s/g out periodically on ur neighbors dog or cat to make sure the
battery is up to power and the circuit's r working right--> note, if the
animal goes into a convulsing, twitching-muscle lock and dies frothing at the
mouth, its putting out too much wattage...tune it down a bit.  U not wanto
to get into the situation wher u zap some ugly-reeking ultimate bad-ass
psycho and have it give him a nasty shock and start an epileptic-provoking
electrical neuro-storm and he goes crazy on ya!!!!!!  Its not as hard as you
might think to test it out and get some practive on a human subject:
The original developers paid a volunteer to pose as a human guini pig...U 2
can put out an ad in some punk-rocker bar and will be surprised at the # of
low-lifes wanting to get off on this 'new drug' or 'ultimate pain dispensor'
ha, one punk gang requires it as an initiation to get into their gang and
if u ever wanted out, u would have to stand up for 5 full secs of 25K wat!
  NOte: 1 sec at 25K wats will stun ua, and posibly confuse u for a bit, as
ur neurons deal with the surge of activity and u hear the crisp crack of
flesh being burned away adn the bright arc of lightning blind ya...5 secs
is usually enuf to knock u unconscious for 30-45 mins.

3) now that u r a certified s/g operator, here are some off/deff strategies for
various situations u may find urself in some fine day...

case A: ur strolling down the street one fine day in may, on the south side
of Chicago, at 3am, don't ask y, ur lost or want to do some s/g practice...
when a dark NEGRO pops down from an overhead fireEscape and kindly says:
'GOOD EVENING, WHITE HONKY-S.O.B-MOTHERFUCKINGCOCKSUCK-A, may ah  borra
100 doll-as???...i will surely pay u back on tuesdday'...now, the best way
to handle this fuckUp is to hand over ur fake wallot with fake-counterFit
bills and fake ID int it...(note: incase he does get away, u not want him to
l8r be caught with ur drivers liscense etc, cuz cases have been known where
some dumbFuck temp. secretary has mistakenly given u his long criminal
record-which could take months and major hassles to fix...)  Always keep ur
real wallot inside the inseams in ur jacket or pants, or inside pockets.
---> do NOT attempt to talk ur way into any kinda deal with by offering
phreak codz etc, as these inner-city scums usually r 9th grade dropouts
whoes volcalbulary consists of < 100 words and will not understand or
believe u!  Now, in tis case, u would not pull out ur s/g, rather, wait
til he is running away THEN zap him!!!  also note that these punks may
have a gun on ya, but usually r NOT loaded, cuz they don't want the
hassles of that either...but it IS loaded, the s/g will cause him to convulse
and may make him pull the trigger, so its best to zap him in the back.

case b: ur driving along at a nice clip along a highWay with ur rader jammer
 when a gang of 'mad max' types chucks a rock thru ur windsheild forcing
u to jam on the brakes and stop...now, if there are about 3-4 of em, just
get out ur s/g and be ready to zap the leader, u no, the big, ugly one...
this will cause the other punks to scatter like flies.  If there are more,
and u have the retractable s/g, zap one, retract, zap the others til u have
them undercontrol...BUT, if they look like they have guns or bombs, HIT
THE GAS AND GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE FAST!!!
Variations on case a: if u are driving an 18 weeler thru the inner city and
got stopped at a light, and u see some 'saba-haba-howba-duba' nigger standing
on the corner with a pair of boltCutters lookin at ya, there are 2 things u
can do here: u no that in 15 secs they have the bac doors open and are D/Ling
crates...1) lay on the airHorn and run the red...2) reverse and crush em
against the car behind, then floor it and run the red...if u don't wanto
do these optons, then booby-trap the bac doors to zap'em...

case c: u gots a burgler breaking in...if he is any good and sees ur array
of strobing LEDs and thinks he can get by, rig up a motion detector to the
s/g and zap him upon entry...u would then have ur sys autoScan #s til it finds
help and plays a digitized voice of the emergency.

Things to do: say u need bux fast, but don't wanta risk a holdup? well then,
merely zap the 7-11 attendant, what could be easier??  or u may even build
a remote controled model helicopter with a zaper on it to hold up a bank...
they already have ultra small cameras that use CCDs, or Charged Coupled
Devices that can see in the dark etc...all crontroled on a microwave freq,
what can they do besides shoot it down or try to jam the freq?  ...well,
i think u can come up with some innovative ideas on ur own...atom...A_I

oh, for info on the kit, see the Sep '86 issue of Radio Electronics mag.
the kit is about $40...there is also some good info bout communications, from
DC to microwave, and other shit...check it out.
ave, and other shit...check it out.

     MANY OF YOU OUT THERE PROBABLY HAVEFANTASIES OF REVENGE AGAINST TEACHERS,  PRINCIPALS AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE JUSTASSHOLES. DEPENDING ON YOUR LEVEL OF    HATRED OF THIS PERSON I WOULD ADVISE    THAT YOU DO SOME OF THESE FOLLOWING     EXPERIMENTS:

     (1) POURING DISHSOAP INTO THE GAS  TANK OF YOUR ENEMY- MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT GASOLINE + DISHSOAP(E.G. JOY, PALMOLIVE, ETC.) FORM A MIXTURE CALLED  NAPALM. NOW NAPALM IS A JELLY-LIKE      SUBSTANCE USED IN BOMBS, FLAMETHROWERS, ETC. NOW YOU CA
N ONLY GUESS WHAT THIS   MIXTURE WOULD DO TO SOMEONE'S FUEL LINE!!!!

     (2) SPREADING DIRTY MOTOR OIL/CASTOR OIL ON SOMEONE'S EXHAUST PIPE- WHEN   THE EXHAUST PIPE HEATS UP(AND IT WILL!!)THE MOTOR OIL OR CASTOR OIL ON THE PIPE WILL CAUSE THICK, DISGUSTING SMOKE TO   OOZE FORTH FROM THE BACK OF THAT CAR.   WHO KNOWS MAYBE
 HE/SHE MIGHT BE PULLED  OVER AND GIVEN A TICKET!!

     (3) LIGHT BULB BOMB- YOU CAN       REPLACE A LIGHT BULB WITH A BOMB THAT   YOU KNOW THAT PERSON WILL USE. A LIGHT BULB CAN BE MADE BY (A) GETTING A TORCH( SUCH AS A PROPANE TORCH VIA K-MART) (B) TAKING A LIGHT BULB AND APPLYING THE    TORCH TO WHERE 
THE BASE OF THE BULB(THE PART YOU SCREW IN) AND THE ACTUAL BULB  MEET. (C) AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE GLASS WILL BECOME SOFT ALLOWING YOU TO       CAREFULLY REMOVE THE BASE FROM THE BULB ITSELF(BE CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE THE     FILAMENT) (D) NOW FILL THE BUL
B WITH    NAPLAM(GAS/DISHSOAP) (E) NOW TAKE SUPER-GLUE AND APPLY IT TO THE GLASS WHERE THE BASE AND GLASS MEET(ALONG THE RIM) (F) NOW INSERT THE BASE INTO THE BULB CAREFULLY. (G) ALLOW TO DRY AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A BOMB (H) NOW REPLACE IN A FIXTURE YOUR E
NEMY IS TO USE THE REGULAR LIGHT BULB WITH THE ONE YOU MADE. MAKE SURE THE LAMP/DESK LIGHT IS OFF!!! NOW WHEN YOUR ENEMY TURNS ON THE LIGHT, HE/SHE IS IN FOR A SUPRISE. BUT BE FOREWARNED THIS WILL MOST LIKELY KILL OR SERIOUSLY INJURE THIS PERSON. FOR A GO
OD TUTORIAL ON HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB BOMB RENT THE MOVIE THE SOLDIER WITH SCOTT GLENN. THERE IS AVERY DETALIED SCENE DESCRIBING HOW TO MAKE IT.

    (4) SIMPLE SMOKE/STINK BOMB- YOU CAN PURCHAASE SULPHUR AT A DRUGSTORE UNDER THE NAME FLOWERS OF SULPHUR. NOW WHEN   SULPHUR BURNS IT WILL GIVE OFF A VERY   STRONG ODOR AND PLENTY OF SMOKE. NOW ALL YOU NEED IS A FUSE FROM A FIRECRACKER, A TIN CAN, AND 
THE SULPHUR. FILL THE CAN WITH SULPHUR(PACK VERY LIGHTLY), PUT ALUNINUM FOIL OVER THE TOP OF THE CAN, POKE A SMALL HOLE INTO THE FOIL, INSERT THE WICK, AND LIGHT IT AND GET OUT OF THE ROOM IF YOU VALUE YOUR LUNGS. YOU CAN    FIND MANY USES FOR THIS( OR AT
 LEAST I  HOPE SO.

FUN WITH ALARMS
 
 
A FACT I FORGOT TO MENTION IN MY PREVIOUS ALARM ARTICLES IS THAT ONE CAN ALSO
USE POLYURETHANE FOAM IN A CAN TO SILENCE HORNS AND BELLS.  YOU CAN PURCHASE
THIS AT ANY HARDWARE STORE AS INSULATION.  IT IS EASIER TO HANDLE AND DRIES
FASTER.
 
MANY PEOPLE THAT TRAVEL CARRY A POCKET ALARM WITH THEM.  THIS ALARM IS A SMALL
DEVICE THAT IS HUNG AROUND THE DOOR KNOB, AND WHEN SOMEONE TOUCHES THE KNOB HIS
BODY CAPACITANCE SETS OFF THE ALARM.  THESE NASTY NUISENCES CAN BE FOUND BY
WALKING DOWN THE HALLS OF A HOTEL AND TOUCHING ALL THE DOOR KNOBS VERY QUICKLY.
 IF YOU HAPPEN TO CHANCE UPON ONE, ATTACH A 3' LENGTH OF WIRE OR OTHER METAL
OBJECT TO THE KNOB.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE SLEEPING BUSINESS PIG INSIDE TO THINK
SOMEONE IS BREAKING IN AND CALL ROOM SERVICE FOR HELP.  ALL SORTS OF FUN AND
GAMES WILL ENSUE.
 
SOME HIGH-SECURITY INSTALATIONS USE KEYPADS JUST LIKE TOUCH-TONE PADS (A
REGISTERED TRADE MARK OF BELL SYSTEMS) TO OPEN LOCKS OR DISARM ALARMS.  MOST
USE THREE OR FOUR DIGITS. TO FIGURE OUT THE CODE, WIPE THE KEY-PAD FREE FROM
ALL FINGERPRINTS.  AFTER IT HAD BEEN USED JUST APPLY FINGER PRINT DUST AND ALL
FOUR DIGITS WILL BE MARKED.  NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT THE ORDER.
 
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN WITH A KEYPAD, TRY PRESSING THE * AND # AT THE
SAME TIME.  MANY UNITS USE THIS AS A PANIC BUTTON.  THIS WILL BRING THE OWNER
AND THE COPS RUNNING AND EVER-ONE WILL HAVE A GOOD TIME.  NEVER TRY TO REMOVE
THEM FROM THE WALL, AS THEY ALL HAVE TAMPER SWITCHES.
 
ON THE SUBJECT OF HOLDUPS, MOST PLACES (INCLUDING SUPER-MARKETS, LIQUER STORES,
ETC.) HAVE WHAT IS KNOWN AS A MONEY CLIP.  THESE LITTLE NASTIES ARE PLACED AT
THE BOTTOM OF A MONEY DRAWER AND WHEN THE LAST FEW BILLS ARE WITH-DRAWN A
SWITCH CLOSES AND SETS THE ALARM OFF.  THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR WITHDRAWL
IT'S BEST TO HELP YOUR-SELF SO YOU CAN CHECK FOR THESE LITTLE NASTIES.  IF YOU
FIND THEM, MERELY INSERT ONES UNDERNEATH THE PILE OF TWENTIES, AND THEN PULL
OUT THE TWEN-TIES, LEAVING THE ONE-DOLLAR BILL BEHIND TO PREVENT THE CIRCUIT
FROM CLOSING.
 
IF YOU SHOPLIFT AND SEE CAMERAS, LOOK AT THE BRAND.  IF IT IS SURVEILLANCE
VIDEO SYSTEMS (SVS) YOU NEED NOT WORRY. THESE CAMERAS LOOK REALISTIC TO THE
POINT OF PILOT LIGHTS, COAX, AND SCANNING.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE ONLY EMPTY BOXES.

(>READ> HOW TO MAKE TNT
How to make TNT
 
By  THE SCREAMER
*s*c**re*a***m**e**r*
 
Probably the most important explosive compond in use today is TNT (trinitrotoluene).  This and other very similar types of high explosives ar all used by the military, because of their fantastic power- about 2.25 millions pounds per square inch, and there
 great stability.  TNT also has the great advantage of being ableto be melted at 82 degrees F., so that it can be poured into shells, mortars, or any other projectiles.  Military TNT comes in containers which resemble dryu cell batteries, and are usually 
ingnited by an electrical charge, coupled with an electical blasting cap, although there are other methods.
 
Preparation of TNT
 
1. Take two beakers.  In the first prepare a solution of 76 percent sulfuric acid, 23 percent nitric acid and 1 percent water.  In the other beaker, prepare another solution of 57 percent nitric acid and 43 percent sulfuric acid (percentages are on a weig
ht ratio rather than volume).
 
2. Ten grams of the first solutions are poured into an empty beaker and placed in an ice bath.
 
3. Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.
 
4. remove this beaker from the ice bath and gently heat until it reaches 50 degrees C.  The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.
 
5. Fifty additional grams of the acid, from the first beaker, are added and the temperature is held for the next ten minutes, and an oily liquid will begin to form on the top of the acid.
 
6. After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice bath, and cooled to 45 begrees C> when reaching this temperature, the oily liquid will sink and collect at the bottom of the beaker.  Atr this point, the remaining acid solution should be
 drawn off, by using a syringe.
 
7. Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily liquid while the temperature is SLOWLY being raised to 83 degrees C.  After this temperature is reached, it is maintaind for a full half hour.
 
8. At the end of this period, he solution is allowed to cool to 60 degrees C>, and is held at this temperature  for another full half hour.  After this, the acid is again drawn off, leaving once more only the oily liquid at the bottem.
 
9. Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added, while the oily liquid is gently heated to 80 degrees C.  All temperature increases must be accoumplished slowly and gently.
 
10.Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second acid solution are added, and the temperature is raised from 80 dgregrees C> to 104 degrees C., and is held for three hours.
 
11.After this three hour period, the mixture is lowered to 100 degrees C. and held there for a half hour.
 
12.After this half hour, the oil is removed form the acid and washed with boiling water.
 
13.After the washing with boiling water, while being stired constantly, the TNT will begin to solidify.
 
14.When the solidification has started, cold water is added to the beaker, so that the TNT will form into pellets.  Once this is done, you have a good quality TNT.
 
NOTE: the temperatures used in the preparation of TNT are EXACT, and must be used as such.  DO NOT estimate or use aproximations.  Buy a good centigrade thermometer.
 
The author take NO RESPONSIBILITY for any damage to persons or property for this formula.  It is supplied for STUDY PURPOSES ONLY.

   THIS IS AN ANTI-PERSONNEL BOMB MEANT FOR MILLING CROWDS. THE BOTTOM OF A
SOFT DRINK CAN IS HALF CUT OUT AND BENT BACK. A GIANT FIRECRACKER OR OTHER
EXPLOSIVE IS PUT IN AND SURROUNDED WITH NUTS AND BOLTS OR ROCKS. THE FUSE IS
THEN ARMED WITH A CHEMICAL DELAY IN A PLASTIC DRINKING STRAW.
 
   AFTER FIRST MAKING SURE THERE ARE NO CHILDREN NEARBY, THE ACID OR
GLYCERINE IS PUT INTO THE STRAW AND THE CAN IS SET DOWN BY A TREE OR
WALL WHERE IT WILL NOT BE KNOCKED OVER. THE DELAY SHOULD GIVE YOU THREE
TO FIVE MINUTES. IT WILL THEN HAVE A SHATTERING EFFECT ON PASSERSBY.
 
   IT IS HARDLY LIKELY THAT ANYONE WOULD PICK UP AND DRINK FROM SOMEONE
ELSE'S SOFT DRINK CAN. BUT IF SUCH A CRUDE PERSON SHOULD TRY TO DRINK FROM
YOUR BOMB HE WOULD BREAK A NASTY HABIT FAST!

*******************************************************************************

Materials Required:
==================

              Sulphuric Acid (Battery Acid)
              Gasoline
              Potassium Chlorate (Drug Store)
              Sugar
              Glass bottle w/stopper (roughly 1 quart size)
              Small bottle or jar w/lid
              Rag or absorbent paper (newspaper, paper towels, etc.)
              String or rubber bands

Procedure:
=========

1)  Sulphuric Acid Must be Concentrated. If battery acid or other dilute acid
    is used, concentrate it by boiling until dense white fumes are given off.
    Container used should be of eenamelware or oven glass.

CAUTION:  Sulphuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is
          spilled, wash it away with a large quantity of water.  Fumes are also
          dangerous and should not be inhaled.

2)  Remove the acid from heat and allow to cool to room temerature.

3)  Pour gasoline into the large (1 quart) bottle until it is approximately
    2/3 full.

4)  Add concentrated sulphuric acid to gasoline slowly until the bottle is
    filled to within 1' to 2' from top.  Place the stopper on the bottle.

5)  Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

CAUTION:  If this is not done, the fire bottle may be dangerous to handle
          during use.

6)  Wrap a clean cloth or several sheets of absorbent paper around the outside
    of the bottle.  Tie with string or fasten with rubber bands.

7)  Dissolve 1/2 cup (100 gm) of potassium chlorate and 1/2 cup (100 gm) of
    sugar in one cup (250 cc) of boiling water.

8)  Allow the solution to cool, pour into the small bottle and cap tightly.
    The cooled solution should be approx. 2/3 crystals and 1/3 liquid.  If
    there is more liquid than this, pour off excess before using.

CAUTION:  Store this bottle separately from the other bottle.

How To Use:
==========

1)  Shake the small bottle to mix contents and pour onto the cloth or paper
    around the large bottle.  Bottle can be used wet or after solution has
    dried.  However, when dry, the sugar - Potassium chlorate mixture is very
    sensitive to spark or flame and should be handled accordingly.

2)  Throw or launch the bottle.  When the bottle breaks against a hard surface
    (target) the fuel will ignite.

Conclusion:
==========

    This weapon proves to be very useful in torching Assholes and/or their
    possessions.  Use your imagination.

 Okay...There are certain ways to take 
money out of a change machine...
 
1) You can blow the fucker up..
2) You can use this quick and easy method


  Heres what ya do....

 I.
   There are certain types of money
changing machines...The one YOU need
is the kind where ya put yer bill in
the tray <lengthwise> ,push the tray
in to get yer change...

 II.
   Once you got the right machine,get
a $5 or a $1 ,it helps if the bill is
WRINKLED...Then tear a notch in the 
bill on the lower left side of the 
bill.Cut the notch about 3.5 cm. from
the lower left hand corner...

III.
    Now, go to the machine..put the 
bill in the tray and slide it in...
Now what will happen is the machine
will have so far read the bill right
and it will spit out yer change..
Then when it reads the notch, it 
will think the bill is fucked up and 
reject it  and like you will have the 
change  and yer bill...

 For this to werk right you must have
done this right..it does take practice
 but once you can do this your local
Money Changer will be yer bank...

 oh yeah one more thing..dont tell
or upload this file to to many places
otherwise every fuckin person in the 
nation will be doin this  and this 
file would be no use....  
  whatever...

What it is
----------

This handy little device can be used for two purposes. The first is a FM bug,
which transmits on the FM frequency, thus making it extremely easy to pick up.
The second is a FM station blocker (which can be really fun if you are pissed
at someone who just happens to be listening to the radio. In this case, you 
can do 1 (or both) of these: A) announce through the bug (on their station)
that Fred (whoever is listening) has just won 1 years supply of orthopedic
shoe pads, or B) disconnect the mike, and let it fry the station.) In this
file, I will make some incredibly lame schematics, which any fool can follow,
(lets see you make good schematics with Apple Writer), and tell you all the
junk you need (duh..) Ok, if you have no electronics background at all, go
ahead and try it anyways (hell, it's not my money your wasting on parts)

How to operate
--------------

1. Turn on (duh..)

2. Turn the variable capacitor until you are on the station that you want to 
 use (preferably towards either end, so if they turn on their radio, they
don't get a bunch of audio feedback when they hit your station)

3. This bug does not have a long range (50 ft max), but if you use a large 
 antenna on your stereo (like the rooftop kind) the range is greatly increased
. I prefer to use a AM/FM walkman, so I can get close to the bug, and tape what
I want.

TIME DELAYED CHEMICAL FUSE
--------------------------
 
1) Put 1 teaspoon full of of potassium
   permanganate in a tin can.
 
2) add glycerine
 
3) wait 3-4 min.
 
4) get the hell out.. the stuff will
   smoke, then burst into flame..
 
 
** potasium permanganate stains like
   iodine but worse [it's purple]
 
** the reaction will spatter a bit
   ->it can be messy...
 
** it doesn't matter if the amounts
   are uneven [ie. 1 part to 3 parts]

ALUMINUM KILLER (OVERNIGHT)
---------------
 
silver iodide --> aluminum iodide
 + aluminum        + silver
 
              ..or..
 
 
AgI + Al --> Ag + AlI
 
ALUMINUM IODIDE is very hydroscopic --
it will absorb water [it will even
absorb water out of the air!]
 
SILVER IODIDE eats through aluminum --
the resulting aluminum iodide will
>disolve itself< as it aborbs H20 from
the air!
The final result is aluminum with a
wet hole in it. [the wetness is AlI
solution]
 
 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
THERMITE
--------
 
This stuff can burn *anything*. [except
Tungsten].. It's great for burning
open a fortress fone [a pay phone, for
those who do not know]
 
Here is the step-by-step on how to make
it.
 
 
1) First you need rust. The best way
   to make alot of it is....
 
      a) get an electric train trans-
         former
      b) attach a common nail to the
         PLUS (+) end of the trans-
         former
      c) get a glass jar
      d) fill it with water
      e) put salt [regular table salt
         is fine] into the water
      f) put the other end (-) into
         water with the nail [leave the
         transformer out, of course]
      g) turn on the transformer
      h) let the contraption run over-
         night
      i) seperate out all the red shit
         [that's the rust] with a
         filter or a spoon.
      j) let the stuff dry [like on
         a paper towel]
      k) that's it! you have rust!
 
2) Get some aluminum filings from the
   hardware store [or shave your own
   from a bar with less that 94% pure
   aluminum, called duralumin]
 
3) Now, just mix:
 
           8 grams rust
     --------------------------
      3 grams aluminum filings
 
4) That's Thermite!! Now, to ignite
   it...
 
5) You now need some Magnesium ribbon.
   To get it, you can:
 
       a) steal it from the chemistry
          lab at school
       b) buy it at the hardware store
       c) buy it from a chemical
          supply house.
 
6) Alright, shove the Magesium ribbon
   into the Thermite at a fuse.
 
7) Then light it with a blowtorch.
   [It won't get hot enough to ignite
   the Thermite, though]
 
8) last step: get the hell back.
   [it can vaporize CARBON STEEL!]
 
 
** my thanx to the person who wrote
   the file "Thermite".. whoever the
   hell you are.....................
   [put your name in if you ever get
   this]

          PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS
          ------------------

              Commonly known as "zip" guns, guns made from pipe have been used for years by juvenile punks.  Today's Militants make them just for the hell of it or to shoot once in an assassination or riot and throw away if there is any danger of apprehen
sion.

              They can be used many times but with some, a length of           dowel is needed to force out the spent shell.

              There are many variations but the illustration shows the           basic design.

              First, a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for           the barrel to rest in.  The barrel is then taped securely to           the stock with a good, strong tape.

              The trigger is made from galvanized tin.  A slot is           punched in the trigger flap to hold a roofing, which is           wired or soldered onto the flap. The trigger is bent and           nailed to the stock on both sides.

              The pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas           or water pipe with a bore that fits in a cartridge, yet keeps the cartridge rim from passing through the pipe.

              The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap, with a           hole bored through it, is screwed on.  Then the trigger is
          slowly released to let the nail pass through the hole and           rest on the primer.

              To fire, the trigger is pulled back with the left hand           and held back with the thumb of the right hand.  The gun is then aimed and the thumb releases the trigger and the thing actually fires.

              Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in           any hardware store.  All caliber bullets, from the .22 to           the .45 are used in such guns.

              Some zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested           within each other.  For instance, a .22 shell will fit           snugly into a length of a car's copper gas line.           Unfortunatey, the copper is too weak to withstand the

          pressure of the firing.  So the length of gas line is spread           with glue and pushed into a wider length of pipe.  This is spread with glue and pushed into a length of steel pipe with threads and a cap.

              Using this method, you can accomodate any cartridge,           even a rifle shell.  The first size of pipe for a rifle           shell accomodates the bullet.  The second accomodates its           wider powder chamber.

              A 12-gauge shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel           pipe.  If you want to comply with the gun laws, the barrel           should be at least eighteen inches long.

              Its firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol.           It naturally has a longer stock and its handle is lengthened into a rifle butt.  Also, a small nail is driven half way into each side of the stock about four inches in the fr
ont of the trigger.  The rubber band is put over one nail and  brought around the trigger and snagged over the other nail.

              In case you actually make a zip gun, you should test it           before firing it by hand.  This is done by first tying the gun to a tree or post, pointed to where it will do no damage.  Then a string is tied to the trigger and you go off s
everal yards.  The string is then pulled back and let go. If the barrel does not blow up, the gun is safe to fire by           hand.

              You should not attempt to register such a gun.                          Pipe Cap

Hey, check out the facts,let's see
what they do for your PARANOIA:
 
 Natural gas flows through millions of
miles of piplines in the U.S. One
charge will blow up a gas pipeline  
along miles of its length since the
air let into the pipeline by the exp-
losion will cause secondary explosions.
Of 65 pipelines,24 carry 97% of the gas
which accounts for more than one-third
of the nation's total energy supply.
Only 4 pipelines connects the gas      
fields in the South and Southwest to
New York and Los Angeles. Maps of the
lines can be obtanied from the Dept-
ment ofEnergy and by studying industry
journals.
 
 
 Oil pipelines can be destroyed by
penetrating the central pipeline cont-
rol system. In one Southern city, which
controls oil movement in several states. 
  Yikes! And contrary to the argument
advanced by some self-styled special-
ists and the news media that few poss-
ess the technological expertise to use
weapons of mass destruction, it is 
much much easier than you think.
  
  There's a book giving location,pub-
lished in the New York Times,Feb 1979,
two large map pinpointing every power
station and transmission line from
Washington to the Canadian border.
Blowing up some of these stations and
lines would wipe out the electrical
supply of the East Coast.
 
  For another example, the a Book
called 'Basement Nukes, $6.95, by
some guy named, Charles Clark. 
Title of the book is :
  Technological Terrorism $10.00
 
Clark shows how they canb  be readily
obtained by theft from inefficently
guarded nuclear plants and armories.
 Both of the above mentioned books
are readily available to anyone with
the buck, how sad,huh...shit!
 
 Technological Terrorism is a nightmare
scenario,and a serious warning to every
one of us.
 
 That really screws up the old head.

EXPLOSIVES AND INCENDIARIES by THE
RESEARCHER


INTRODUCTION: The trouble with text
books on chemistry and explosives is
the attitude with which they are
written. They don't say, "Now I know
youuwould like to blow holy hell out of
something just for the fun of it so
here is how to whip up something in 
your kitchen to do it". They tell you
how Dupont does it or how the anchient
Chineese did it but not how you can do
it with the resourses and materials
available to you. Even army manuals on
field expedient explosives are almost
useless because they are just outlines
written with the understanding that an
instructor is going to fill in the
blanks. It is a fun game to search out
the materials that can be put together
to make something go "boom". You can
find what you need in grocery stores,
hardware stores, and farm supplies. An
interesting point to remember is that
it is much easier to make a big e
xplosion than a small one. It is very
difficult for a home experimenter to
make a firecracker, but a bomb capable
of blowing the walls out of a building
is easy. The king of explosives for the
do-it-yourselfer is black powder. It is
easy to make and when properly confined
is capable of devestating power. CLOSEINFORM
ootable powder used for
spraying. It is cheap and works well.
Some drug stores sell sulfur under the
name Flowers of Sulfur. If you use
Nitrate of Soda, it will be in the form
of prills (little round beads). Bake it
in an oven at 250 degrees for 10-15
minutes to drive out the moisture. Then
dump a cup or two into a blender and
switch it on. It will do a beautiful
job of reducing it to powder. Buy a bag
of charcoal briquettes at a grocery
store. Put a few briquettes in a rag
and pound with hammer. Dump the result
into the blender, grind, then strain
through a tea strainer. Mix by volume:
6 parts potassium or Sodium Nitrate, 2
parts powdered charcoal, 1 part sulfur.
This mixture will burn if ignited and
will explode if ignited while tightly
confined. It can be greatly improved,
however, by processing it as follows:
Moisten with water until it will stick
together when pinched between thumb and
finger. Press it into a disposable
aluminum pie pan. Bake in a preheated
oven at 250 degrees for about 30
minutes--get it totally dry. Grind into
as fine a powder as possible. A mortar
and pestle is best. If you use a
blender at this point, there is a
danger of explosion. It is not very
sensative to friction or impact, but is
very sensative to sparks. If you
followed these directions, you should
have a fine slate-grey powder.

When baking black powder, remember to
preheat the oven. Place your pie pan
approximately in the center of the
oven. Do not set it on the bottom of
the oven. These warnings are to prevent
hot spots that could ignite the powder
causing a fire or explosion. Something
went wrong once when my father-in-law
was doing this and it blew the door
right off the oven. His training in
military demolitions included field
expedient explosives. The point is that
things can go wrong even when you know
what you are doing. Protect yourself at
all times. Use common sense. Wear
safety glasses; don't stand in front of
oven, etc. HOW TO MAKE BLACKMATCH FUSE:
Take a flat piece of plastic or metal
(brass or aluminum are easy to work
with and won't rust). Drill a 1/16th
inch hole through it. This is your die
for sizing the fuse. You can make fuses
as big as you want, but this is the
right size for the pipe bomb I will be
getting to later. To about 1/2 cup of
black powder add water to make a thin
paste. Add 1/2 teaspoon of corn starch.
Cut some one foot lengths of cotton
thread. Use cotton, not silk or thread
made from synthetic fibers. Put these
together until you have a thickness
that fills the hole in the die but can
be drawn through very easily. Tie your
bundle of threads together at one end.
Separate the threads and hold the
bundle over the black powder mixture.
Lower the threads with a circular
motion so they start curling onto the
mixture. Press them under with the back
of a teaspoon and continue lowering
them so they coil into the paste. Take
the end you are holding and thread it
through the die. Pull it through
smoothly in one long motion. To dry
your fuse, lay it on a piece of
aluminum foil and bake it in your 250
degree oven or tie it to a grill in the
oven and let it hang down. The fuse
must be baked to make it stiff enough
for the uses it will be put to later.
Air drying will not do the job. If you
used Sodium Nitrate, it will not even
dry completely at room temperatures.
Cut the dry fuse with sissors into 2
inch lengths and store in an air tight
container. Handle this fuse carefuly to
avoid breaking it. You can also use a
firecracker fuse if you have any
available. The fuses can usually be
pulled out without breaking. To give
yourself some running time, you will be
extending these fuses (blackmatch or
firecracker fuse) with sulfured wick.
HOW TO MAKE SULFURED WICK: Use heavy
cotton string about 1/8th inch in
diameter. You can find some at a garden
supply for tieing up your tomatoes. Be
sure it's cotton. You can test it by
lighting one end. It sould continue to
burn after the match is removed and
when blown out will have a smoldering
coal on the end. Put some sulfur in a
small container like a small pie pan
and melt it in the oven at 250 degrees.
It will melt into a transparent yellow
liquid. If it starts turning brown, it
is too hot. Coil about a one foot
length of string into it. The melted
sulfur will soak in quickly. When
saturated, pull it out and tie it up to
cool and harden. It can be cut to
desired lengths with sissors. 2 inches
is about right. These wicks will burn
slowly with a blue flame and do not
blow out easily in a moderate wind.
They will not burn through a hole in a
metal pipe, but are great for extending
your other fuse. They will not throw
off sparks. Blackmatch generates sparks
which can ignite it along its length
causing unpredictable burning times.
Now you have the basic ingredients to
shake the earth like thunder. In the
next installment or two, I will tell
you how to put it all together to do ju
st that. You will find that you have
baked a very deadly pie. I have twice
been accused of setting off dynamite in
the woods. The explosive power of your
little grey powder may exceed your
expectations, so choose your testing
ground with care.

HOW TO MAKE A PIPE BOMB: Buy a section
of metal water pipe 1/2 by 6 inches
long, threaded on both ends. Buy two
metal caps to fit. These are standard
items in hardware stores. Drill a
1/16th hole in the center of the pipe.
This is easy with a good drill bit.
Hanson is a good brand to use. Screw a
metal cap tightly on one end. Fill the
pipe to within 1/2 inch of the top with
black powder. Do not pack the powder.
Don't even tap the bottom of the pipe
to make it settle. You want the powder
loose. For maximum explosive effect,
you need dry, fine powder sitting loose
in a very rigid container. Wipe off any
powder that has gotten onto the top or
threads of the pipe. Gently screw on
the second cap. Hand tighten only.
Place a small piece of tape over the
hole and go to your test site. Remove
the tape and insert a two inch piece of
black match fuse or a firecracker fuse
into the hole. Place the bomb behind a
large rock or tree. Using thread or
string, lightly tie a 2 inch piece of
sulfured wick to the end of the fuse.
Avoid letting the wick touch any
objects. This might cause it to go out.
Light the wick and head for cover in a
direction that keeps the rock or tree
between you and the bomb at all times.
Get behind cover at least 50 yards
away. You may not expect such a large
explosion from such a small object. Be
extra cautious until You have done this
a time or two and it gets real what you
are dealing with. The pipe will be
blown to pieces which will fly through
the air like bullets. An accident could
seriously wound or kill you. This is
not a big firecracker. It is more like
a hand grenade. The size of the bomb
can be increased by using a larger pipe
and caps. To make a big noise without
blowing up your pipe, cap one end only.
Drill a 1/16 hole at the top of the
threads at the capped end. Put in about
3 to 4 rounded teaspoonsful of powder.
Pack about 2 inches of wadding on top
of the powder. Toilet paper or kleenex
is good for this. Pack it tight. Open
up a safety pin and stick it into the
hole. Work it around to loosen up the
powder so a fuse can be inserted. When
this goes off, the recoil will be
tremendous. You will loose your pipe
unless you brace it securely against
something. The pipe can be reloaded and
used again. A fun trick is to mount the
pipe pointing upward. Drop a tin can
over the open end and light the fuse.
The can will be blown high into the
air. Campbell's soup cans are great for
this. HOW TO MAKE ROCKET FUEL: This is
easy to make and fun to play with. Mix
equal parts by volume Potassium or So
dium Nitrate and granulated sugar. Pour
a big spoonful of this into a pile.
Stick a piece of blackmatch fuse into
it; light; and step back. This is also
a very hot incendiary. A little
imagination will suggest a lot of
experiments for this. ANOTHER ROCKET
FUEL: Mix equal parts by volume of zinc
dust and sulfur. Watch out if you
experiment with this. It goes off in a
sudden flash. It is not a powerful
explosive, but is violent stuff even
when not confined because of its fast
burning rate. --- As I continue from
this point some of the ingredients are
going to be harder to get without going
through a chemical supply. I try to
avoid this. I happen to know that B.
Prieser Scientific (local to my area)
has been instructed by the police to
send them the names of anyone buying
chemicals in certain combinations. For
example, if a person were to buy
Sulfuric acid, Nitric acid and Toluene
(the makings for TNT) in one order the
police would be notified. I will do the
best I can to tell you how to make the
things you need from commonly available
materials, but I don't want to leave
out something really good because you
might have to scrounge for an
ingredient. I am guessing you would
prefer it that way.

HOW TO MAKE AN EXPLOSIVE FROM COMMON
MATCHES: The word "safety" in safety
matches is misleading. The chemical on
the heads of safety matches is a
powerful explosive. It is similar to
black powder but has a lower ignition
temperature (more sensative to heat)
and unlike black powder is easily
detonated by impact. This feature moves
it up into the high explosives class.
To test this, lay a paper safety match
on a hard flat surface and hit the head
sharply with a hammer. What do you
know! It goes bang! To collect a
quantity of this explosive, it is best
to use wooden safety matches. Buy
several cartons. They're cheap. Note
that these should be safety matches,
not the strike anywhere kind. Pinch the
head near the bottom with a pair of
wire cutters to break it up; then use
the edges of the cutters to scrape off
the loose material. It gets easy with
practice. You can do this while
watching TV and collect enough for a
bomb without dieing of boredom. Once
you have a good batch of it, you can
load it into a pipe instead of black
powder. Be careful not to get any in
the threads, and wipe off any that gets
on the end of the pipe. Never try to
use this stuff for rocket fuel. A
science teacher was killed that way.
Just for fun while I'm on the subject
of matches, did you know that you can
strike a safety match on a window pane?
Hold a paper match between your thumb
and first finger. With your second
finger, press the head firmly against a
large window. Very quickly, rub the
match down the pane about 2 feet while
maintaining the pressure. The friction
will generate enough heat to light the
match. Another fun trick is the match
rocket. Tightly wrap the top half of a
paper match with foil. Set it in the
top of a pop bottle at a 45 degree
angle. Hold a lighted match under the
head until it ignites. If you got it
right, the match will zip up and hit
the ceiling. I just remembered the
match guns I used to make when I was a
kid. These are made from a bicycle
spoke. At one end of the spoke is a
piece that screws off. Take it off and
screw it on backwards. You now have a
piece of stiff wire with a small hollow
tube on one end. Pack the material from
a couple of wooden safety matches into
the tube. Force the stem of a match
into the hole. It sould fit very
tightly. Hold a lighted match under the
tube until it gets hot enough to ignite
the powder. It goes off with a bang.
--- For later projects, like a chemical
time delay fuse, you will need some
concentrated sulfuric acid. So, I
better tell you how to make it. HOW TO
MAKE CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID FROM
BATTERY ACID: Go to an auto supply
store and ask for "a small battery
acid". This should only cost a few
dollars (about 4 dollars). What you
will get is about a gallon of dilute
sulfuric acid. Put a pint of this into
a heat resistant glass container. The
glass pitchers used for making coffee
are perfect. Do not use a metal
container. Use an extension cord to set
up a hotplate out doors. Boil the acid
until white fumes appear. As soon as
you see the white fumes, turn off the
hot plate and let the acid cool. Pour
the now concentrated acid into a glass
container. The container must have a
glass stopper or plastic cap -- no
metal. It must be air tight. Otherwize,
the acid will quickly absorb moisture
from the air and become diluted. Want
to know how to make a time bomb that
doesn't tick and has no wires or
batteries? Hold on to your acid and
follow me into the next installment.

HOW TO MAKE A CHEMICAL TIME DELAY FUSE:
To get an understanding of how this is
going to work, mix up equal parts by
volume Potassium chlorate and
granulated sugar. Pour a spoonful of
the mixture in a small pile and make a
depression in the top with the end of a
spoon. Using a medicine dropper, place
one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid
in the depression and step back. It
will snap and crackle a few times and
then burst into vigorous flames. To
make the fuse, cut about 2 inches off a
plastic drinking straw. Tamp a small
piece of cotton in one end. On top of
this put about an inch of the
clorate/sugar mixture. Now lightly tamp
in about a quarter inch of either glass
wool or asbestos fibers. Secure this
with the open end up and drop in 3 or 4
drops of sulfuric acid. After a few
minutes the acid will soak through the
fibers and ignite the mixture. The time
delay can be controled by the amount of
fiber used and by varying how tightly
it is packed. Don't use cotton for
this. The acid will react with cotton
and become weakened in the process. By
punching a hole in the side of the
straw, a piece of blackmatch or other
fuse can be inserted and used to set
off the device of your choice.
Potassium chlorate was very popular
with the radical underground. It can be
used to make a wide variety of
explosives and incendiaries, some of
them extremely dangerous to handle. The
radicals lost several people that way.
But, don't worry. I am not going to try
to protect you from yourself. I have
decided to tell all. I will have more
to say about Potassium chlorate, but
for now, let's look at a couple of
interesting electric fuses.

HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC FUSE: Take a
flashlight bulb and place it glass tip
down on a file. Grind it down on the
file until there is a hole in the end.
Solder one wire to the case of the bulb
and another to the center conductor at
the end. Fill the bulb with black
powder or powdered match head. One or
two flashlight batteries will heat the
fillament in the bulb causing the
powder to ignite. ANOTHER ELECTRIC
FUSE: Take a medium grade of steel wool
and pull a strand out of it. Attach it
to the ends of two pieces of copper
wire by wrapping it around a few turns
and then pinch on a small piece of
solder to bind the strand to the wire.
You want about 1/2 inch of steel strand
between the wires. Number 18 or 20 is a
good size wire to use. Cut a 1/2 by 1
inch piece of cardboard of the type
used in match covers. Place a small
pile of powdered match head in the
center and press it flat. place the
wires so the steel strand is on top of
and in contact with the powder.
Sprinkle on more powder to cover the
strand. The strand should be surounded
with powder and not touching anything
else except the wires at its ends.
Place a piece of blackmatch in contact
with the powder. Now put a piece of
masking tape on top of the lot, and
fold it under on the two ends. Press it
down so it sticks all around the
powder. The wires are sticking out on
one side and the blackmatch on the
other. A single flashlight battery will
set this off. ELECTRIC FUSE # 3: An
excellent electric fuse can be bought
ready made at hobby and toy stores. The
y are sold for setting off model
rockets.

MORE SPONTANIOUS COMBUSTION: Some of
the ingredients for these can only be
had from a chemical supply so they are
not my favorites. Look for powdered
aluminum at a good painting supply.
METHOD # 1: Scatter out a few crystals
of chromic anhydride. Drop on a little
ethyl alcohol. It will burst into flame
immediately. METHOD # 2: Mix by weight,
four parts ammonium chloride, one part
ammonium nitrate, four parts powered
zinc. Pour out a small pile of this and
make a depression on top. Put one or
two drops of water in the depression.
Stay well back from this. METHOD # 3:
Put one gram of powdered potassium
permanganate into a paper cup. Drop two
drops of glycerine onto it. After a few
seconds it will burst into flames.
METHOD # 4: Spoon out a small pile of
powdered aluminum. Place a small amount
of sodium peroxide on top of this. A
volume the size of a small pea is about
right. One drop of water will cause
this to ignite in a blinding flare.
METHOD # 5: Mix by volume 3 parts
concentrated sulfuric acid with 2 parts
concentrated nitric acid. Hold a
dropper of turpentine about 2 feet
above the mixture. When drops strike
the acid they will burst into flame.

HOW TO MAKE NITROGEN TRIIODIDE: Here
are some notes I took four years ago on
how to make this wild explosive that
can be detonated by a fly walking on
it. Five grams iodine, three grams
potassium iodide, 20 ml. concentrated
ammonium hydroxide, filter paper,
funnel. Stir the potassium iodide and
iodine together in a beaker with 50 ml.
of water. Add the ammonium hydroxide
with stirring until no more precipitate
forms. Filter and spread a thin layer
of the wet solid on several filter
papers. Break the filter papers into
many small pieces and allow to dry for
several hours. On drying, the paper is
extremely sensitive to touch and will
explode violently with the slightest
disturbance. Can be handled safely when
wet. Do not let any sizeable quantity
of the dry material accumulate. --- I
was able to buy concentrated ammonium
hydroxide from a photographic supply.

           (_>Shadow Hawk 1<_)

I actually got this from a movie, and
have tried it [IT WORKS!!!]. Ok you may
have to do this a couple times before
you get it. Heres what you need:

A few light bulbs
Torch [one that will melt glass, radio
       shack single cylender model will
       do]
Some gasoline
Some liquid soap
Some epoxy glue

Heres what you do:

1) Make a hole in the light bulb like
   this:



                   *
                  ---
                  : :
  Make hole here  : :  or here.
                \ / \ /
                 /   \
                :     :
                :     :
                 \---/
             Not here!!!!!

2) Making the hole, like in the diagram
[dont make it on the bottom, because if
the seal you will make should break,
the person/room you want to eliminate
will notice the hole [and the gasoline
on the floor!!!] whereas the if its on
top it will still work...

3) Now carefully fill the light bulb
about half full with gas, and then the
rest with soap [hold on angle if you
have to]. Now epoxy the hole shut, and
screw it in...

have phun

                           MAKING THERMITE
                            BY X CALIBUR
 
      THERMITE IS A POWERFUL SUBSTANCE WHICH CAN BURN THROUGH PRACTICALLY
ANYTHING, SAVE TUNGSTEN. IT IS SPECIALLY OF USE IN TRYING TO CRACK
OPEN A FORTRESS FONE.  NOW HERE'S HOW YOU MAKE IT. IT IS VERY SIMPLE.
      THE FIRST STEP IN MAKING THERMITE IS TO MAKE HEMATITE. IN LAYMAN'S TERMS,
EMATITE IS IRON OXIDE (RUST). HERE IS GOOD METHOD OF MAKING LARGE QUANTITIES
OF RUST. OU WILL ELECTROLYZE A METAL ROD, SUCH AS A COMMON NAIL. YOU WILL
NEED A SURCE OF DC POWER AS WELL. AN ELECTRIC TRAIN TRANSFORMER IS PERFECT.
ATTATCH THE ROD TO THE POSITIVE WIRE. THEN PLACE THE ROD AND THE NEGATIVE
                      ^^^^^^^^
WIRE IN OPPOSITE SIDES OF A GLASS JAR FILLED WITH WATER. PUT A LITTLE SALT
IN THE WATER, JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT CONDUCT WELL (A TEASPOON). LET THE
SETUP SIT OVERNIGHT. IN THE MORNING, HERE WILL BE A DARK RED CRUD IN THE
JAR. FILTER ALL THE CRUD OUT OF THE WATER OR JUST FISH IT OUT WITH A SPOON.
NOW YOU WILL NEED TO DRY IT OUT. HEAT IT I AN IRON POT UNTILL IT ALL TURNS
A NICE LIGHT RED.
      THE OTHER INGREDIANT YOU WILL NEED IS ALUMINUM FILINGS. YOU CAN EITHER
FILE DOWN A BAR OF ALUMINUM, OR (AS I SUGGEST) BUY ALUMINUM FILINGS AT
YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE SHOP. (IF YOU BUY THE BAR USE NO LESS THN 94% PURE
ALUMINUM. IT IS CALLED DURALUMIN.) THAT'S ALMOST IT. NOW, MIX TOGETHER
THE RUST AND ALUMINUM FILINGS. THE RATIO SHOULD BE 8 GRAMS OF RUST PER
3 GRAMS OF ALUMINUM FILINGS. THAT'S THERMITE!
      NOW, TO LIGHT IT! STICK A LENGTH OF MAGNESIUM RIBBON IN A PILE OF THE
THERMITE. (EITHER STEAL IT FROM CHEM LAB OR BUY IT AT YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE
STORE. IF NOT, ORDER FROM A CHEMICAL SUPPLY HOUSE. IT'S PRETTY CHEAP.)
THE RIBBON SHOULD STICK INTO THE THERMITE LIKE A FUSE.  NOW YOU LIGHT THE
MAGNESIUM WITH A BLOWTORCH. (DON'T WORRY. THE TORCH ISN'T HOT ENOUGH TO
LIGHT THE THERMITE.) WHEN THE BURNING MAGNESIUM REACHES THE THERMITE, IT
WILL LIGHT. WHEN THE THERMITE BURNS, GET THE HELL BACK! THAT STUFF CAN
VAPORIZE CARBON STEEL. IT DOES WONDERS ON HUMAN FLESH.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
LETTER BOMBS ARE VERY SIMPLE TO MAKE, BUT THE DIFFICULT PART IS MAKING SURE
IT WILL DETONATE PROPERLY, OR THAT IT IS NOT OBVIOUS THAT IT IS A BOMB.
 
MIXTURES:
ABOUT 75% ALUMINUM POWDER WITH 25% IRON POWER IS BEST.  THIS IS A LIGHT
VERSION OF THERMITE, SINCE IT IS IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE (THE ENVELOPE, AS
DESCRIBED BELOW A WAYS). MIX THE ABOVE WELL.  THE IDEA IS
THIS:  IRON CAN BURN, AT A VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE, BUT IT NEEDS A LITTLE
HELP.  THIS IS WHAT THE ALUMINUM IS FOR.  ALUMINUM BURNS AT A RELATIVELY
LOW TEMPERATURE, SO IT IS USED AS A CATALYST OF SORTS.  MAGNESIUM IS USED
TO FLASH-IGNITE THE ALUMINUM, WHICH THEN BURNS THE IRON, AT A SUITABLE
TEMPERATURE.  SINCE THIS IS GOING OFF IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE, IT WILL BURN
MUCH HOTTER AND SLOWER AND WITH MORE VIOLENCE THAN A NORMAL MIX.
I ADVISE YOU PLAY WITH THIS FOR A WHILE, LEARNING YOUR MIXTURE.
 
NOW FOR THE FUN STUFF:
GET AN INSULATED (PADDED) ENVELOPE, THE TYPE THAT IS DOUBLE LAYERED.
SEPERATE THE LAYERS.  IN THE INNER LAYER GOES THE WONDERFUL MIXTURE,
ONE YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH.  KEEP THIS SECTION SEPERATE, BUT IT MIGHT
BE HANDLE TO TOP IT OFF WITH SOME MAGNESIUM.  THE OUTER LAYER CAN BE
EITHER MAGNESIUM, FOR A FLASH BOMB, OR POSSIBLY A MATERIAL OF YOUR OWN
CHOICE.
  
NOW FOR THE DIFFICULT PART! THE FUSE...   WE CAN MAKE A FUSE
FROM ANOTHER SET OF CHEMICALS: IODINE CRYSTALS, AND AMONIUM HYDROXIDE,
IN LIQUID FORM.  MIX THESE TOGETHER,IN ABOUT AND EQUAL AMOUNT, BUT YOU 
MIGHT WANT TO USE A HEAVY AMOUNT OF IODINE IF PRESSED FOR TIME.  THESE
FORM A NEW CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE, ABOUT AND INCH LONG.  THESE ARE HIGHLY
VOLATILE, AND I ADVISE KEEPING THEM PROTECTED.  THEY HAVE ABOUT THE IMPACT
POWER OF AN M-100 FOR A TEASPOON. I PUT THESE IN A PROTECTIVE CARD-BOARD
LINING, AND PUT THEM AT THE TOP OF THE ENVELOPE.  RIG THIS SO IT PUTS
PRESSURE ON

    How to get Revenge on Someone
    -----------------------------
Written by Black Fire and Capt. Cloner
 
 
  Everyone has an enemy that they would
like to seek revenge on without the
victim knowing who the aggressor is.
Here are ways that have been proven
effective in the field of harrasing 
and/or annoying someone.
 
  Call the news papers, and adverise
an arctile similar to this:  "You too
can make calls free through MCI, ITT,
and other long distance services just
by making a local call.  For more
information, send a self-adressed
stamped envlope to:(fill in name and
adress with zip code)"  After this has
appeared in the papers, inform your
local FBI agent or police officer of
his ad.  You can also advertise an ad
like this: "Apple //e, 128k, 2 disk
drives, Amdek Color 3 Monitor, Hayes
Smartmodem 1200, and much more.  $750
or best offer. (phone number)".
 
  Another prank is to call house at all
hours, and post on all boards that a
new bulletin board is opening up at
his number.  Get everyone you know to
call him at all times (preferably late
at night.  Call answering machines,
and give the persons number and tell
them to call right away.  Also during
the day you can look up people in the
phone that have a "Mr. and Mrs." there,
and the wife will probably be home, but
not the husband, so tell the wife to 
tell the husband to call your victim
as soon as possible and give number.
Call Taxi's, Exterminators, Pizza
deliverys, Catorers, Garages, Plumers,
Dog Funeral Homes, Flower and Ballon
deliverys, Moving Services, Singing
and Striptease telegrams, Junkyards to
remove garbage, report robberies and
fires at his/her house, Locksmiths,
order oil from several companies 
(heating oil), order family portraits
taken at their home, sign him/her up
for the army, call realtors to put
house for sale, Septic cleaners, house
remodelers, call Bell + tell you are
having with phone, call cable company,
and call phone sex lines that call
back and give his number to call back.
Order plane tickets, send brochures of
all shit like colleges, beauty schools,
and all other things that send info.
on their place, and adress it to:
"DICK" and his last name.
 
  To have a little phun, drop by his
house one day, tie a chain to the back
of you truck/car and the other end to
the victims mailbox.  Take off, and no
more mailbox.  Also, throw eggs at 
house and cars, piss on cars and is gas
tank of cars.  Get 300 sheets+ of paper
and put in a paper shreader and after
it is in 1" by 1" pieces, throw all 
over his lawn in various places.
Another fun thing is to bring along
a baseball bat and knock the shit out
of his mailbox.  Send mail with not
enough postage to them, and wrap up
bricks and rocks and put no return 
adress on them and drop in a mailbox.
Get a library card out in his name, and
take out books and don't return them.
Lay tacks on either side of tires of
his car so either way he will run over
them.  Take weed killer, and pour it
on his flower garden or put your
initials on his front yard with it so
it will show up with dead grass.  You
can also use the old trick of laying
dog shit on his front porch.  Pour
grease all over driveway and steps,
dump your garbage cans over front yard,
when he puts his garbage at the end
of the driveway, dump the cans over the
street so he will have to pick it up in
the morning.  Smear warm tar on his
car windshield, and that shit isn't
coming off.  Crazy Glue or stick gum
over and in his car locks, and if he
goes to school do the same to his
locker.  Catch fish, and let them sit
out in the sun for a day, and that 
night lay the fish in their front yard.
Lay cow shit in their air conditioner,
 and stick sticks in the between the
fan blades for the air conditioner.
The toilet paper around their trees is
always good, and wet toilet paper and
stand out in the street and whip them
at their house, and when it dries, it
is hard as rock stuck to their house.
If they leave toys out, stick skate-
boards under car tires, rip heads off
of dolls, pull seats out bikes, and
let air out of bike tires.  You can
also ride by in the car with your BB
gun, and try your target practice.
Some of this has been tried, and some
not, but remember that it is best to
be near them when these happen, so you
can see their faces.  Never hint who
you are, and warn that you are not
finshed yet.  The best weapon you have
is your phone, because they can't keep
their phone off the hook 24 hrs. a day.
If they take the phone off the hook,
try back in 1/2 hour, and it will be
back on.  Most of these have been
proven effective, and the others will
most likely effective.  We have sat
here for hours thinking of every 
possible method of harrasing, bothing,
and annoying someone to the point of
insanity.  This has been written by
Black Fire with the help of Captain
Cloner.  We will be writing more as
soon as more ideas are tested.  You
will be hearing more from us.  Have
fun, and remember this is only a game!

SO YOU WANT TO BE A CRIMINAL. WELL, IF YOU ARE WANTING TO BE LIKE
JAMES BOND AND OPEN A LOCK IN FIFTEEN SECONDS, GO TO HOLLYWOOD
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE YOUR GONNA DO IT. EVEN EXPERIENCED
LOCKSMITHS CAN SPEND 5 TO 10 MINUTES ON A LOCK IF THEY'RE
UNLUCKY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR EXTREMELY QUICK ACCESS, LOOK
ELSEWHERE.

THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WILL PERTAIN MOSTLY TO THE
"LOCK-IN-KNOB" TYPE LOCK, SINCE IT IS THE EASIEST TO PICK. IF
THERE IS SUFFICIENT DEMAND, I WILL LATER WRITE A FILE DISCUSSING
THE OTHER FORMS OF ENTRANCE, INCLUDING DEAD-BOLT.

FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED A PICK SET. IF YOU KNOW A LOCKSMITH, GET
HIM TO MAKE YOU A SET. THIS WILL BE THE BEST POSSIBLE SET FOR YOU
TO USE. IF YOU FIND A LOCKSMITH WILLING TO SUPPLY A SET, DON'T
GIVE UP HOPE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE YOUR OWN, IF YOU HAVE ACCESS
TO A GRINDER (YOU CAN USE A FILE, BUT IT TAKES FOREVER.)

THE THING YOU NEED IS AN ALLEN WRENCH SET (VERY SMALL). THESE
SHOULD BE SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT INTO THE KEYHOLE SLOT. NOW, BEND
THE LONG END OF THE ALLEN WRENCH AT A SLIGHT ANGLE..(NOT 90 DEG.)
IT SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS:


  #1
       \\
        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\         (THIS IS
                                                      THE HANDLE
                                           \\\        THAT WAS
                                                      ALREADY
                                           \\\        (HERE.)
                                           \\\
                                           \\\
                                           \\\


NOW, TAKE YOUR PICK TO A GRINDER OR A FILE AND SMOOTH THE END
(#1) UNTIL IT'S ROUNDED SO IT WON'T HANG INSIDE THE LOCK.  TEST
YOUR TOOL OUT ON DOORKNOBS AT YOUR HOUSE TO SEE IF IT WILL SLIDE
IN AND OUT SMOOTHLY. NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN.
IS IT SMALL ENOUGH FOR IT AND YOUR PICK TO BE USED IN THE SAME
LOCK AT THE SAME TIME, ONE ABOVE THE OTHER ?

LETS HOPE SO, BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOUR GONNA OPEN IT.


IN THE COMING INSTRUCTIONS, PLEASE REFER TO THIS CHART OF THE
INTERIOR OF A LOCK:

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX| K
 #  #  #  #   #   #    | E
    #     #   #   #    | Y
 *     *               | H
 *  *  *  *   *   *    | O
                       | L
                       | E
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|

#= UPPER TUMLER PIN
*= LOWER TUMLER PIN
X= CYLINDER WALL

(THIS IS A GREATLY SIMPLIFIED DRAWING)

THE OBJECT IS TO PRESS THE PIN UP SO THAT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE
UPPER PIN AND THE LOWER PIN IS LEVEL WITH THE CYLINDER WALL. NOW,
IF YOU PUSH A PIN UP, ITS TENDANCY IS TO FALL BACK DOWN, RIGHT ?

THAT IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN.

INSERT THE SCREWDRIVER INTO THE SLOT AND TURN. THIS TENSION WILL
KEEP THE "SOLVED" PINS FROM FALLING BACK DOWN. NOW, WORK FROM THE
BACK OF THE LOCK TO THE FRONT, AND WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH.....

THERE WILL BE A CLICK, THE SCREWDRIVER WILL TURN FREELY, AND THE
DOOR WILL OPEN. DON'T GET DISCOURAGE ON YOUR FIRST TRY! IT WILL
PROBABLY TAKE YOU ABOUT 20-30 MINUTES YOUR FIRST TIME. AFTER THAT
YOU WILL QUICKLY IMPROVE WITH PRACTICE.

THIS IS BY NO MEANS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF ENTERING A HOUSE.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE ANOTHER ITEM OR TWO DEVOTED TO THESE OTHER
WAYS, LET THE SYSOP KNOW.

                            $^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^
 
                          Typed and uploaded by:
 
-------------------------------=>Sir Knight<=----------------------------------
 
     Napalm is in itself a very simple substance...it can be used for many 
things...(i.e. getting back at your neighor!!)Here's what'cha need:
 
===============================================================================
Gasoline                                Joy or Palmolive(I prefer Joy)
A Coke can with a sawed off top         Ammonia Pellets
A Drill                                 Some bendable wire
A Nail
===============================================================================
 
        First,make a mixture of 1/2 Joy(my favorite),and 1/2 Gasoline.
Take the coke can, and fill it half full with this wonderful mixture...
it should look like this:
 
          -^-^-^-^-^-^-^-
          !             !
          !             ! <-Coke Can
          !             !
          !=============!
          !=============!
          !=============! <-Mixture
          !=============!
          ---------------
 
     Now,take the drill(or some sharp object)and put a hole through the amm-
onia pellet big enough for the nail.. Put the nail through the pellet(which
I might add can be picked up at any farm supply store)and wire that to the
top of the can so the nail can be slipped out easily,allowing the pellet to
drop...WARNING:  DO NOT LET THAT PELLET FALL INTO THE MIXTURE,AS YOUR
WIFE WILL SOON BECOME A WIDOW!! Wait until you are ready to set it off to
let it drop...It should look like this:
 
      (========<+>=========)
      ! ^^Nail  ^^Pellet   !
      !                    !
      !                    !
      !                    !
      !====================!
      !====================! <-Mixture
      !====================!
      !====================!
      ----------------------
 
       And there is your Napalm grenade...if there is enough demand,
there will be another article on more advanced Napalm......

   The best methods of blowing up a car
requires getting under the hood. Explo
sives are placed as near the occupants
as possilbe. NOTE- THIS ARTICLE IS FOR
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT CONTENT TO
PSYCH OUT THE DRIVER WITH SOME PRACT
ICAL JOKE. IF YOU HAVE HIS LAST RIDE
IN MIND, THEN READ ON:

   The fuse, homemade, commercial or
safetey, is wrapped a few turns around
the exhause manifold. After a few min-
utes on the road the exhaust manifold
gets almost red hot and ignites the
fuse.

   This way is more certain than wiring
the car because since it blows up on
the road the wreck will do the victem
in even if the blast doesn't. Besides,
if the intended victim is a passenger
instead of the driver, the driver may
start the engine before the passenger
gets into the car... You can see how
embarrassing that would be to the
bomber, can't you?

   Old-fashioned types, like the Mafia,
love to wire cars. They are too set in
thier ways to change and besides, they
get a charge out of seeing a car blow
up before thier eyes instead of
imagining it going to hell on the road.

   They usually use about three sticks
of dynamite, two lengths of electric
wire with two alligator clips for quick
attachment, and an electric blasting
cap. The cap is stuck into a dynamite
stick and its two wires are connected
to the two electric wires. Then one
alligator clip is clamped to the input
side of the coil and the other is
fastened to any metal surface in the
car's frame as a ground.

   This is very simple and you'd think
anyone could do it. But sure enough,
there are always morons who will attach
one clamp to a spark plug and one to a
ground. This usually results in mis
fires and no end of frustrations.

CHEMIST'S CORNER ARTICLE #1: EXPLOSIVES
BY ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG


    UPLOADED BY -THE TRIXTER-


 THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING SOME DANGEROUS EXPLOSIVE
S. IF YOU INTEND TO MAKE ANY OF THESE EXPLOSIVES, DO SO IN SMALL AMOUNTS ONLY, 
AS THEY ARE ALL DANGEROUS AND COULD SERIOUSLY INJURE OR KILL YOU IF DONE IN LAR
GER AMOUNTS. IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CHEMISTRY, DON'T DO THESE EXPERIM
ENTS! I AM NOT JOKING IN GIVING THIS WARNING. UNLESS YOU HAVE A DEATH WISH, YOU
 SHOULDN'T TRY ANY OF THE FOLLOWING UNLESS YOU HAVE HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH C
HEMICALS.
 I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INJURY OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY PEOPLE USING THIS INFO
RMATION. IT IS PROVIDED FOR USE BY PEOPLE KNOWLEDGABLE IN CHEMISTRY WHO ARE INT
ERESTED IN SUCH EXPERIMENTS AND CAN SAFELY HANDLE SUCH EXPERIMENTS.

===============================================================================


I. COMMON "WEAK" EXPLOSIVES.

 A. GUNPOWDER:
     75% POTASSIUM NITRATE
     15% CHARCOAL
     10% SULFUR
   
      THE CHEMICALS SHOULD BE GROUND INTO A FINE POWDER (SEPERATELY!) WITH A MO
RTER & PESTLE. IF GUNPOWDER IS IGNITED IN THE OPEN, IT BURNS FIERCELY, BUT IF I
N A CLOSED SPACE IT BUILDS UP PRESSURE FROM THE RELEASED GASES AND CAN EXPLODE 
THE CONTAINER. GUNPOWDER WORKS LIKE THIS: THE POTASSIUM NITRATE OXIDIZES THE CH
ARCOAL AND SULFUR, WHICH THEN BURN FIERCELY. CARBON DIOXIDE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE 
ARE THE GASES RELEASED.

 B. AMMONAL:
     AMMONAL IS A MIXTURE OF AMMONIUM NITRATE (A STRONG OXIDIZER) WITH ALUMINUM
 POWDER (THE 'FUEL' IN THIS CASE). I AM NOT SURE OF THE % COMPOSITION FOR AMMON
AL, SO YOU MAY WANT TO EXPERIMENT A LITTLE USING SMALL AMOUNTS.

 C. CHEMICALLY IGNITED EXPLOSIVES:
  
  1. A MIXTURE OF 1 PART POTASSIUM CHLORATE TO 3 PARTS TABLE SUGAR (SUCROSE) BU
RNS FIERCELY AND BRIGHTLY (SIMILAR TO THE BURNING OF MAGNESIUM) WHEN 1 DROP OF 
CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID IS PLACED ON IT. WHAT OCCURS IS THIS: WHEN THE ACID 
IS ADDED IT REACTS WITH THE POTASSIUM CHLORATE TO FORM CHLORINE DIOXIDE, WHICH 
EXPLODES ON FORMATION, BURNING THE SUGAR AS WELL.
  2. USING VARIOUS CHEMICALS, I HAVE DEVELOPED A MIXTURE THAT WORKS VERY WELL F
OR IMITATING VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. I HAVE GIVEN IT THE NAME 'MPG VOLCANITE' (TM).
 HERE IT IS: POTASSIUM CHLORATE + POTASSIUM PERCHLORATE + AMMONIUM NITRATE + AM
MONIUM DICHROMATE + POTASSIUM NITRATE + SUGAR + SULFUR + IRON FILINGS + CHARCOA
L + ZINC DUST + SOME COLORING AGENT. (SCARLET= STRONTIUM NITRATE, PURPLE= IODIN
E CRYSTALS, YELLOW= SODIUM CHLORIDE, CRIMSON= CALCIUM CHLORIDE, ETC...).
  3. SO, DO YOU THINK WATER PUTS OUT FIRES? IN THIS ONE, IT STARTS IT. MIXTURE:
 AMMONIUM NITRATE + AMMONIUM CHLORIDE + IODINE + ZINC DUST. WHEN A DROP OR TWO 
OF WATER IS ADDED, THE AMMONIUM NITRATE FORMS NITRIC ACID WHICH REACTS WITH THE
 ZINC TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN AND HEAT. THE HEAT VAPORIZES THE IODINE (GIVING OFF P
URPLE SMOKE) AND THE AMMONIUM CHLORIDE (BECOMES PURPLE WHEN MIXED WITH IODINE V
APOR). IT ALSO MAY IGNITE THE HYDROGEN AND BEGIN BURNING.
     AMMONIUM NITRATE: 8 GRAMS
     AMMONIUM CHORIDE: 1 GRAM
     ZINC DUST: 8 GRAMS
     IODINE CRYSTALS: 1 GRAM
  4. POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE + GLYCERINE WHEN MIXED PRODUCES A PURPLE-COLORED FL
AME IN 30 SECS-1 MIN. WORKS BEST IF THE POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE IS FINELY GROUND
.
  5. CALCIUM CARBIDE + WATER RELEASES ACETYLENE GAS (HIGHLY FLAMMABLE GAS USED 
IN BLOW TORCHES...)

II. THERMITE REACTION.

  THE THERMITE REACTION IS USED IN WELDING, BECAUSE IT GENERATES MOLTEN IRON AN
D TEMPERATURES OF 3500 C (6000F+). IT USES ONE OF THE PREVIOUS REACTIONS THAT I
 TALKED ABOUT TO START IT! 

  STARTER=POTASSIUM CHLORATE + SUGAR
  MAIN PT.= IRON (III) OXIDE + ALUMINUM POWDER (325 MESH OR FINER)

    PUT THE POTASSIUM CHLORARE + SUGAR AROUND AND ON TOP OF THE MAIN PT. TO STA
RT THE REACTION, PLACE ONE DROP OF CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID ON TOP OF THE STA
RTER MIXTURE. STEP BACK! THE RATIOS ARE: 3 PARTS IRON(III) OXIDE TO 1 PART ALUM
INUM POWDER TO 1 PART POTASSIUM CHLORATE TO 1 PART SUGAR.
 WHEN YOU FIRST DO IT, TRY 3G:1G:1G:1G!
 ALSO, THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE STARTER FOR THE THERMITE REACTION. THE ALTERNATI
VE IS POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE + GLYCERINE. AMOUNTS: 55G IRON(III) OXIDE, 15G ALU
MINUM POWDER, 25G POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE, 6ML GLYCERINE.

III. NITROGEN-CONTAINING HIGH EXPLOSIVES.

  A. MERCURY(II) FULMINATE
      TO PRODUCE MERCURY(II) FULMINATE, A VERY SENSITIVE SHOCK EXPLOSIVE, ONE M
IGHT ASSUME THAT IT COULD BE FORMED BY ADDING FULMINIC ACID TO MERCURY. THIS IS
 SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT SINCE FULMINIC ACID IS VERY UNSTABLE AND CANNOT BE PURCHASE
D. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT WITHOUT FULMINIC ACID. 
YOU ADD 2 PARTS NITRIC ACID TO 2 PARTS ALCOHOL TO 1 PART MERCURY. THIS IS THEOR
ETICAL (I HAVE NOT YET TRIED IT) SO PLEASE, IF YOU TRY THIS, DO IT IN VERY* SMA
LL AMOUNTS AND TELL ME THE RESULTS.

  B. NITROGEN TRIIODIDE
      NITROGEN TRIIODIDE IS A VERY POWERFUL AND VERY SHOCK SENSITIVE EXPLOSIVE.
 NEVER STORE IT AND BE CARFUL WHEN YOU'RE AROUND IT- SOUND, AIR MOVEMENTS, AND 
OTHER TINY THINGS COULD SET IT OFF.

MATERIALS-
   2-3G IODINE
   15ML CONC. AMMONIA
   8 SHEETS FILTER PAPER
   50ML BEAKER
   FEATHER MOUNTED ON A TWO METER POLE
   EAR PLUGS
   TAPE
   SPATULA
   STIRRING ROD

  ADD 2-3G IODINE TO 15ML AMMONIA IN THE 50ML BEAKER. STIR, LET STAND FOR 5 MIN
UTES.
DO THE FOLLOWING WITHIN 5 MINUTES!
   RETAIN THE SOLID, DECANT THE LIQUID (POUR OFF THE LIQUID BUT KEEP THE BROWN 
SOLID...). SCAPE THE BROWN RESIDUE OF NITROGEN TRIIODIDE ONTO A STACK OF FOUR S
HEETS OF FILTER PAPER. DIVIDE SOLID INTO FOUR PARTS, PUTTING EACH ON A SEPERATE
 SHEET OF DRY FILTER PAPER. TAPE IN POSITION, LEAVE TO DRY UNDISTURBED FOR AT L
EAST 30 MINUTES (PREFERRABLY LONGER). TO DETONATE, TOUCH WITH FEATHER. (WEAR EA
R PLUGS WHEN DETONATING OR COVER EARS- IT IS VERY LOUD!)

  C. CELLULOSE NITRATE (GUNCOTTON)

       COMMONLY KNOWN AS SMOKELESS POWDER, NITROCELLULOSE IS EXACTLY THAT- IT D
OES NOT GIVE OFF SMOKE WHEN IT BURNS.

MATERIALS-
  70ML CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID
  30ML CONCENTRATED NITRIC ACID
  5G ABSORBENT COTTON
  250ML 1M SODIUM BICARBONATE
  250ML BEAKER
  ICE BATH
  TONGS
  PAPER TOWELS

   PLACE 250ML BEAKER IN THE ICE BATH, ADD 70ML SULFURIC ACID, 30 ML NITRIC ACI
D. DIVIDE COTTON INTO .7G PIECES. WITH TONGS, IMMERSE EACH PIECE IN THE ACID SO
LUTION FOR 1 MINUTE. NEXT, RINSE EACH PIECE IN 3 SUCCESSIVE BATHS OF 500ML WATE
R. USE FRESH WATER FOR EACH PIECE. THEN IMMERSE IN 250ML 1M SODIUM BICARBONATE.
 IF IT BUBBLES, RINSE IN WATER ONCE MORE UNTIL NO BUBBLING OCCURS. SQUEEZE DRY 
AND SPREAD ON PAPER TOWELS TO DRY OVERNIGHT.


  D. NITROGLYCERINE

    NITROGLYCERINE IS A *VERY* DANGEROUS SHOCK SENSITIVE EXPLOSIVE. IT IS USED 
IN MAKING DYNAMITE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.
    I AM NOT SURE AS TO THE PROPORTIONS AND AMOUNTS OF CHEMICALS TO BE USED, SO
 I SHALL USE ESTIMATES.

MATERIALS-
  70ML CONC. SULFURIC ACID
  30ML CONC. NITRIC ACID
  10 ML GLYCERINE
  ICE BATH
  150ML BEAKER

   PUT THE 150ML BEAKER IN THE ICE BATH AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS VERY COLD. SLO
WLY ADD THE 70ML SULFURIC AND 30ML NITRIC ACIDS TO THE BEAKER, TRYING TO MAINTA
IN A LOW TEMPERATURE. WHEN THE TEMPERATURE STARTS TO LEVEL OFF, ADD ABOUT 10ML 
GLYCERINE. IF IT TURNS BROWN OR LOOKS FUNNY, **RUN LIKE HELL**. WHEN NITROGLYCE
RINE TURNS BROWN, THAT MEANS IT'S READY TO EXPLODE... IF IT STAYS CLEAR AND ALL
 WORKS WELL, KEEP THE TEMPERATURE AS LOW AS YOU CAN AND LET IT SIT FOR A FEW HO
URS. YOU THEN SHOULD HAVE SOME NITROGLYCERINE, PROBABLY MIXED WITH NITRIC AND S
ULFURIC ACIDS. WHEN YOU SET IT OFF, YOU MUST NOT BE NEARBY. NITROGLYCERINE CAN 
FILL 10,000 TIMES ITS ORIGINAL AREA WITH EXPANDING GASES. THIS MEANS THAT IF YO
U HAVE 10ML'S OF NITROGLYCERINE IN THERE, IT WILL PRODUCE SOME 100,000ML'S OF G
ASES.
   TO MAKE IT INTO DYNAMITE, THE NITROGLYCERINE MUST BE ABSORBED INTO SOMETHING
 LIKE WOOD PULP OR DIAMAECEOUS EARTH (SPELLED SOMETHING LIKE THAT).


IV. OTHER STUFF

  A. PEROXYACETONE

   PEROXYACETONE IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE SHOCK SENSI
TIVE.

MATERIALS-
  4ML ACETONE
  4ML 30% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
  4 DROPS CONC. HYDROCHLORIC ACID
  150MM TEST TUBE

 ADD 4ML ACETONE AND 4ML HYDROGEN PEROXIDE TO THE TEST TUBE. THEN ADD 4 DROPS C
ONCENTRATED HYDROCHLORIC ACID. IN 10-20 MINUTES A WHITE SOLID SHOULD BEGIN TO A
PPEAR. IF NO CHANGE IS OBSERVED, WARM THE TEST TUBE IN A WATER BATH AT 40 CELSI
US. ALLOW THE REACTION TO CONTINUE FOR TWO HOURS. SWIRL THE SLURRY AND FILTER I
T. LEAVE OUT ON FILTER PAPER TO DRY FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS. TO IGNITE, LIGHT A 
CANDLE TIED TO A METER STICK AND LIGHT IT (WHILE STAYING AT LEAST A METER AWAY)
.

  B. SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE...

   THE FOLLOWING REACTION SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIR AMOUNT OF SMOKE. SINCE THIS REA
CTION IS NOT ALL THAT DANGEROUS YOU CAN USE LARGER AMOUNTS IF NECESSARY FOR LAR
GER AMOUNTS OF SMOKE.

   6G ZINC POWDER
   1G SULFUR POWDER

    INSERT A RED HOT WIRE INTO THE PILE, STEP BACK. A LOT OF SMOKE SHOULD BE CR
EATED.





 THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXPERIMENTS I COULD HAVE INCLUDED, BUT I WILL SAVE THEM F
OR THE NEXT CHEMIST'S CORNER ARTICLE. UPCOMING ARTICLES WILL INCLUDE GLOW-IN-TH
E-DARK REACTIONS, 'PARTY' REACTIONS, THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS
, AND MORE...

 I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE CREDIT TO A BOOK BY SHAKASHARI ENTITLED "CHEMICAL DEMONST
RATIONS" FOR A FEW OF THE PRECISE AMOUNTS OF CHEMICALS IN SOME EXPERIMENTS.

THE CHEMIST'S CORNER
ARTICLE #2: HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS
BY ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG




 THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DO SOME INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS
 WITH COMMON HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS. SOME MAY OR MAY NOT WORK DEPENDING ON THE CON
CENTRATION OF CERTAIN CHEMICALS IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND BRANDS. I WOULD SUGGEST 
THAT THE PERSON DOING THESE EXPERIMENTS HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY, ESPEC
IALLY FOR THE MORE DANGEROUS EXPERIMENTS.
 I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INJURY OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY PEOPLE USING THIS INFO
RMATION. IT IS PROVIDED FOR USE BY PEOPLE KNOWLEDGABLE IN CHEMISTRY WHO ARE INT
ERESTED IN SUCH EXPERIMENTS AND CAN SAFELY HANDLE SUCH EXPERIMENTS.

===============================================================================


I. A LIST OF HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AND THEIR COMPOSITION

VINEGAR: 3-5% ACETIC ACID
BAKING SODA: SODIUM BICARBONATE
DRAIN CLEANERS: SODIUM HYDROXIDE
SANI-FLUSH: 75% SODIUM BISULFATE
AMMONIA WATER: AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE
CITRUS FRUIT: CITRIC ACID
TABLE SALT: SODIUM CHLORIDE
SUGAR: SUCROSE
MILK OF MAGNESIA- MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE
TINCTURE OF IODINE- 47% ALCOHOL, 4% IODINE
RUBBING ALCOHOL- 70 OR 99% (DEPENDS ON BRAND) ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (DO NOT DRINK!)

ETC... 


EXP #1: YE OLD FIZZ EXPERIMENT

 MIX VINEGAR WITH BAKING SODA. IT PRODUCES SODIUM ACETATE AND CARBONIC ACID. CA
RBONIC ACID QUICKLY DECOMPOSES INTO CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER, RESULTING IN THE 
"FIZZ".
 THIS SIMPLE REACTION CAN BE CONTAINED IN A SMALL BOTTLE OR SOMETHING, AND WHEN
 ENOUGH PRESSURE BUILDS UP IT WILL BREAK OPEN. I SINCERELY DOUBT THAT IT WILL B
LOW "ALL FOUR WALLS OFF THE HOUSE" AS SOME LOSER WROTE IN HIS SAFEHOUSE ARTICLE
. THE SAME BASIC THING CAN BE DONE WITH DRY ICE & WATER, BAKING POWDER & WATER,
 CITRIC ACID & BAKING SODA, AND MANY OTHER COMBINATIONS.

EXP #2: A FRUITY BATTERY

 IF YOU'RE EVER IN NEED OF A LITTLE POWER, GET YOUR HANDS ON THESE:

 A CITRUS FRUIT (LEMON, ORANGE, ETC)
 A SMALL ZINC STRIP
 A SMALL COPPER STRIP

  JUST STICK THE ZINC STRIP IN ONE END OF A LEMON AND A COPPER STRIP IN THE OTH
ER. YOU NOW HAVE A 1.5 VOLT BATTERY! JUST ATTACH THE WIRES TO THE COPPER & ZINC
 STRIPS... 


EXP #3: GENERATING CHLORINE GAS

 THIS IS SLIGHTLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE OTHER TWO EXPERIMENTS, SO YOU SHOUILD
 KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING BEFORE YOU TRY THIS... 

 EVER WONDER WHY AMMONIA BOTTLES ALWAYS SAY 'DO NOT MIX WITH CHLORINE BLEACH', 
AND VISA-VERSA? THAT'S BECAUSE IF YOU MIX AMMONIA WATER WITH AJAX OR SOMETHING 
LIKE IT, IT WILL GIVE OFF CHLORINE GAS. TO CAPTURE IT, GET A LARGE BOTTLE AND P
UT AJAX IN THE BOTTOM. THEN POUR SOME AMMONIA DOWN INTO THE BOTTLE. SINCE THE C
HLORINE IS HEAVIER THAN AIR, IT WILL STAY DOWN IN THERE UNLESS YOU USE LARGE AM
OUNTS OF EITHER AJAX OR AMMONIA (DON'T!). FOR SOMETHING FUN TO DO WITH CHLORINE
 STAY TUNED....


EXP #4: CHLORINE + TURPENTINE

 TAKE A SMALL CLOTH OR RAG AND SOAK IT IN TURPENTINE. QUICKLY DROP IT INTO THE 
BOTTLE OF CHLORINE. IT SHOULD GIVE OFF A LOT OF BLACK SMOKE AND PROBABLY START 
BURNING...


EXP #5: GENERATING HYDROGEN GAS

 TO GENERATE HYDROGEN, ALL YOU NEED IS AN ACID AND A METAL THAT WILL REACT WITH
 THAT ACID. TRY VINEGAR (ACETIC ACID) WITH ZINC, ALUMINUM, MAGNESIUM, ETC. YOU 
CAN COLLECT HYDROGEN IN SOMETHING IF YOU NOTE THAT IT IS LIGHTER THAN AIR.... L
IGHT A SMALL AMOUNT AND IT BURNS WITH A SMALL *POP*. 
 ANOTHER WAY OF CREATING HYDROGEN IS BY THE ELECTROLYSIS OF WATER. THIS INVOLVE
S SEPERATING WATER (H2O) INTO HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN BY AN ELECTRIC CURRENT. TO DO
 THIS, YOU NEED A 6-12 VOLT BATTERY, TWO TEST TUBES, A LARGE BOWL, TWO CARBON E
LECTRODES (TAKE THEM OUT OF AN UNWORKING 6-12 VOLT BATTERY), AND TABLE SALT. DI
SSOLVE THE SALT IN A LARGE BOWL FULL OF WATER. SUBMERGE THE TWO TEST TUBES IN T
HE WATER AND PUT THE ELECTRODES INSIDE THEM, WITH THE MOUTH OF THE TUBE AIMING 
DOWN. CONNECT THE BATTERY TO SOME WIRE GOING DOWN TO THE ELECTRODES. THIS WILL 
WORK FOR A WHILE, BUT CHLORINE WILL BE GENERATED ALONG WITH THE OXYGEN WHICH WI
LL UNDOUBTEDLY CORRODE YOUR COPPER WIRES LEADING TO THE CARBON ELECTRODES... (T
HE TABLE SALT IS BROKEN UP INTO CHLORINE AND SODIUM IONS, THE CHLORINE COMES OF
F AS A GAS WITH OXYGEN WHILE SODIUM REACTS WITH THE WATER TO FORM SODIUM HYDROX
IDE....). THEREFORE, IF YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON SOME SULFURIC ACID, USE IT IN
STEAD. IT WILL NOT AFFECT THE REACTION OTHER THAN MAKING THE WATER CONDUCT ELEC
TRICITY.


EXP #6: HYRDOGEN + CHLORINE

 TAKE THE TEST TUBE OF HYDROGEN AND COVER THE MOUTH WITH YOUR THUMB. KEEP IT IN
VERTED, AND BRING IT NEAR THE BOTTLE OF CHLORINE (NOT ONE THAT HAS REACTED WITH
 TURPENTINE). SAY "GOODBYE TEST TUBE", AND DROP IT INTO THE BOTTLE. THE HYDROGE
N AND CHLORINE SHOULD REACT AND POSSIBLY EXPLODE (DEPENDING ON PURITY AND AMOUN
T OF EACH GAS). AN INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS IS THEY WILL NOT REACT IF IT IS
 DARK AND NO HEAT OR OTHER ENERGY IS AROUND. WHEN A LIGHT IS TURNED ON, ENOUGH 
ENERGY IS PRESENT TO CAUSE THEM TO REACT...

EXP #7: PREPARATION OF OXYGEN

 GET SOME HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (FROM A DRUG STORE) AND MANGANESE DIOXIDE (FROM A B
ATTERY- IT'S A BLACK POWDER). MIX THE TWO IN A BOTTLE, AND THEY GIVE OFF OXYGEN
. IF THE BOTTLE IS STOPPERED, PRESSURE WILL BUILD UP AND SHOOT IT OFF. TRY LIGH
TING A WOOD SPLINT AND STICKING IT (WHEN ONLY GLOWING) INTO THE BOTTLE. THE OXY
GEN WILL MAKE IT BURST INTO FLAME. EXPERIMENT WITH IT. THE OXYGEN WILL ALLOW TH
INGS TO BURN BETTER...

EXP #8: ALCOHOL

 BUY SOME RUBBING ALCOHOL IN A DRUG STORE. USUALLY THIS IS EITHER 70% OR 99% AL
COHOL AND BURNS JUST GREAT. YOU CAN SOAK A TOWEL IN WATER AND THEN IN ACOHOL, L
IGHT THE TOWEL, AND WHEN IT FINISHES BURNING THE ALCOHOL, THE FLAME SHOULD GO O
UT AND LEAVE THE TOWEL UNHARMED. NICE FOR "PARTY TRICKS", ETC. 

EXP #9: IODINE?

 TINCTURE OF IODINE CONTAINS MAINLY ALCOHOL AND A LITTLE IODINE. TO SEPERATE TH
EM, PUT THE TINCTURE OF IODINE IN A METAL LID TO A BOTTLE AND HEAT IT OVER A CA
NDLE. HAVE A STAND HOLDING ANOTHER METAL LID DIRECTLY OVER THE TINCTURE (ABOUT 
4-6 INCHES ABOVE IT) WITH ICE ON TOP OF IT. THE ALCOHOL SHOULD EVAPORATE, AND T
HE IODINE SHOULD SUBLIME, BUT SHOULD REFORM IODINE CRYSTALS ON THE COLD METAL L
ID DIRECTLY ABOVE. IF THIS WORKS (I HAVEN'T TRIED), YOU CAN USE THE IODINE ALON
G WITH HOUSEHOLD AMMONIA TO FORM NITROGEN TRIIODIDE (DISCUSSED IN ARTICLE #1).

EXP #10: GRAIN-ELEVATOR EXPLOSION!

 WANT TO TRY YOUR OWN 'GRAIN-ELEVATOR EXPLOSION'? GET A CANDLE AND SOME FLOUR..
. LIGHT THE CANDLE AND PUT SOME FLOUR IN YOUR HAND. TRY VARIOUS WAYS OF GETTING
 THE FLOUR TO LEAVE YOUR HAND AND BECOME DUST RIGHT OVER THE CANDLE FLAME. THE 
ENORMOUS SURFACE AREA ALLOWS ALL THE TINY DUST PARTICLES TO BURN, WHICH THEY DO
 AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, COMBINING TO FORM A FIREBALL EFFECT. IN GRAIN ELEVATOR
S, MUCH THE SAME THING HAPPENS. IF YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON SOME LYCOPODIUM PO
WDER, DO. THIS WILL WORK MUCH BETTER, CREATING HUGE FIREBALLS THAT ARE UNEXPECT
ED.


 THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW... MORE TO COME IN LATER CHEMIST'S CORNER ARTICLES...

  I am not too sure on how this works
but I am pretty sure that you can make
a really powerful bomb by taking a can
of draino and mixing it with Chlorox.
I think that these two compuonds will
spontaniously explode so don't just pour
them together. I think what you do is
get the draino in a cardboard can and
then put it in a bucket of chlorox
and what will happen is either the
draino or chlorox will eat through
the cardboard and they will meet and
explode. You might want to experiment
with this by rigging it up so you can
cause the two to combine while you
stand a distance a way. I reccomend
extreme caution with this and wear
goggles definately.... Just like
pour some chlorox into a pan and
then have a can of draino with a
string tied to it so you can make it
spill into the chlorox... Be Care
full. I don't need a law suit...

** WARNING **

Richie Rich and the staff of Pearl City Networks is not responisible for
any damage done while doing the following experiments...do it at your own
risk!!!!

winston smith and mr.mojo risin present:
an anarchist's beginning guide to explosives! (or how to get back at those
neighbors who told you to turn your stereo down by blowing em up!)

1.quickie...

    take organic pool chlorine and mix it with vegtable shortening and put it
someplace you don't like.  it reacts by itself to produce a very noxious white
smoke and heat.
 
2.a pipe bomb (dangerous)

    take a pipe crimp (closed at one end) and pack it 3/4 full of parafin.  (or
any other semi-solid with about the samebasic chemical structure)  poke a
number of holes through the length of the parafin.  on top of this put a very
thin steel (or other metal of that sort) wafer, make double damn sure** that
it fits tightly all the way around.  on top of this put some high concentration
hcl (or similar acid).  close the top now, stand it on end (parafin end down),
and get the f*ck away.  you should have about 2-5 minutes depending on the
thickness of the wafer.  watch out for shrappnel.

3.  snowball...

     take ammonium iodide, flour, & water and form this into a snowball.
leave this 'snowball' somewhere where it will do neat stuff when it dries out.
(substituting some magnesium flash powder for some (not all) of that flour
helps things a bit.)
 
4.fire bomb..

    take carbon disulfide and dissolve white phosphorous in it. put it in a 
stoppered bottle and throw it at something you would like to see on fire.
when the cs2 evaporates, it leaves a film of p on what ever it hits, and it
starts a fire with the solvent vapors.
 
5. light bulb bomb (click...booom!)

    take a light bulb (brass based preferably so you can solder the wires back
when you are done)  unsolder the two wires that are soldered to the brass.
(one at the center of the bass and one on the side)  remove the base taking
care not to damage the bulb or filiment.
  take a pair of needle nosed pliers and snap the glass nipple that is now
exposed.  fill bulb (not completely) via the hole you just made with gasoline.
plug hole with silicone or something. put the base back on. resolder the wires
  screw into light fixture (with power off of course!) turn on light...booom!
 
mr.mojo risin and winston smith assume no responsiblity for personal injury or
damage to property cause by these devices of destruction. anarchy rules!

  IN NO WAY AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR FOR ANY INJURIES CAUSED BY THE USE/MISUSE
OF THESE DRUGS.  YOU SHOULD TREAT THESE DRUGS LIKE ALCOHOL.  USE THEM ONLY AS
AN ADDED EXPERIENCE IN LIFE, RATHER THAN AN ESCAPE.

  THESE RECIPES ARE ALL FOUND IN A BOOK WHICH HAS RELIABLE SOURCES.  ALL SHOULD
WORK IF MADE PROPERLY.

+-------------------------------------+
!  MAKING L.S.D. IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN  !
+-------------------------------------+

1]  GRIND UP 150 GRAMS OF MORNING GLORY SEEDS OR BABY HAWAIIAN WOOD ROSE SEEDS.

2]  IN 130 C.C. OF PETROLEUM ETHER SOAK THE SEEDS FOR 2 DAYS.

3]  FILTER THE SOLUTION THROUGH A TIGHT SCREEN.

4]  THROW AWAY LIQUID, AND ALLOW SEEDS MUSH TO DRY.

5]  FOR 2 DAYS ALLOW THE MUSH TO SOAK IN 110 C.C. OF WOOD ALCOHOL.

6]  FILTER THE SOLUTION AGAIN, SAVING THE LIQUID AND LABELING IT '1'

7]  RESOAK THE MUCH IN 110 C.C. OF WOOK ALCOHOL FOR 2 DAYS.

8]  FILTER AND THROW AWAY MUSH.

9]  ADD LIQUID FROM THE SECOND SOAK TO THE LIQUID LABELED '1'.

10] POUR THE LIQUID INTO A COOKIE TRAY AND ALLOW IT TO EVAPORATE.

11] WHEN ALL LIQUID HAS EVAPORATED, A YELLOW GUM REMAINS.  THIS SHOULD
    BE SCRAPED AND PUT IN CAPSULES.

     30 GRAMS OF MORNING GLORY SEEDS
                  - OR -
       15 HAWAIIAN WOOD ROSE SEEDS
               - EQUALS -

                ONE TRIP

** NOTE ** MANY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO COAT THIER SEEDS WITH TOXIN.
ORDER SEEDS FROM A WHOLESALER.

+-------------------------------------+
! OTHER VARIOUS LEGAL & ILLEGAL DRUGS !
+-------------------------------------+

--> BANANDINE (MADE FROM BANANA!)

BANANAS DO CONTAIN A SMALL QUANTITY OF A MILD SHORT LASTING PSYCHODELIC DRUG.
THERE ARE BETTER WAYS OF GETTING HIGH BUT THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF THIS IS THAT
BANANAS AE LEGAL (OF COURSE!)

1]  OBTAIN 15 LBS OF RIPE YELLOW BANANAS

2]  PEEL THEM ALL, EAT THE CHOW, KEEP THE PEELS.

3]  WITH A SHARP KNIFE, SCRAPE OFF THE INSIDES OF THE PEELINGS, AND SAVE
    THE SCRAPED MATERIAL.

4]  PUT ALL SCRAPED MATERIAL IN A LARGE POT AND ADD WATER.  BOIL FOR THREE
    TO FOUR HOURS UNTIL IT HAS ATTAINED A SOLID PASTE.

5]  SPREAD THIS PASTE ON COOKIE SHEETS AND DRY IN OVEN FOR ABOUT 20 MIN.
    TO A HALF AN HOUR.  THIS WILL RESULT IN A FINE BLACK POWDER
    ROLL IT UP AND SMOKE ABOUT 3-4 OF THOSE DUDES

--> COUGH SYRUP? (SURE, WHY NOT?)

MIX ROBOTUSSION A-C WITH AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF GINGER ALE AND DRINK.  NOTE
THAT YOU CAN OVERDOSE ON THIS ONE!

--> GLUE...YUCK!

PUT HALF A TUBE OF AIRPLANE GLUE ON ANY (I MEAN, IN ANY) PLASTIC BAG AND SNIFF
IT.  IT'S REALLY GROSS BUT SOME PEOPLE REALLY GET INTO IT..

--> HEROINE

DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE ON IT...

--> PEANUTS!

1] OBTAIN A POUND OF PEANUTS.

2] SHELL THEM, SAVING THE SKINS AND DISCARDING THE SHELLS.

3] PORK OUT ON THE NUTS WHILE WATCHING DR. WHO ONE NIGHT.

4] GRIND UP THE SKINS, ROLL THEM, SMOKE THEM.

--> TOAD SKINS? YOU'RE CRAZY!!

1]  COLLECT 5-10 TOADS

2]  KILL THEM AS PAINLESSLY AS POSSIBLE AND SKIN THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!

3]  ALLOW SKINS TO DRY ON THE FRIDGE FOR 4 TO 5 DAYS, OR UNTI THEY ARE
    BRITTLE.

4]  CRUSH INTO A POWDER AND SMOKE.  DUE TO THE BAD TASTE, MIX IT WITH MINT
    OR SOMETHING ELSE.

+-------------------------------------+

PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THESE THESE DRUGS SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR AN ADDITIONAL
EXPERIENCE IN LIFE.  DO NOT USE THEM AS AN ESCAPE, OR JUST FOR THE HELL OF
IT!  SEE YA, AND HAVE FUN??!!..??!!..

     Well first of all I reccommend
that you read the file on my board
about landmines... If you can't then
here is the conecpt. You can use an
m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other
type of elxplose that will light with
a fuse. Now the way this works is
if you have a 9volt batery, from a
radio ctlred car or what ever and
get either a solor igniter (preferably)
or some steel wool you can create
a remote ignition system. What you
do it set up a schematic like this.

        ------------------>+ batery
 steel ||                ->- batery
 wool  ||                /
  :==:---  <--fuse       \
       ||                /
       ---- spst switch--\

So when the switch is on the currnet
will flow through the steel wool or
igniter and heat up causing the fuse
to light.
     Note: For use with steel wool
try it first and get a really thin
peice of wire and pump the current
through it to make sure it will heat
up to light the explosive.

**********************************
Now the thing to do is plant your
explosive whereever you want it to
be but bury it and cover the wires
obviously... Now take a this wire
fishing line is good about 20 lb.
test and tie one end of the wire
to a secure object. Have your switch
secured to seomthing to and make a
loop on the other end on the line.
Put the loop around the switch such
that when pulled it will pull the
switch and set off the explosive.

to ignite the explosive... The thing
to do is to experiment with this
and find your best method... Let me
know on any good kills, or new
techniques... On my board...

+------------------------------------+
! KING ARTHUR'S DEMOLITION ARTICLE #1!
+------------------------------------+
 
 
     LIKE ALL CHEMISTS I MUST ADVISE
YOU ALL TO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE AND
CAUTION WHEN YOU ARE DOING THIS.  EVEN
IF YOU HAVE MADE THIS STUFF BEFORE.
 
     THIS FIRST ARTICLE WILL GIVE YOU
INFORMATION ON MAKING NITROGLYERIN, THE
BASIC INGREDIENT IN A LOT OF EXPLOSIVES
SUCH AS STRAIGHT DYNAMITES, AND GELETIN
DYNAMITES.
 
--------------------------------------
 
         MAKING NITROGLYCERIN
 
--------------------------------------
 
 
     1. FILL A 75-MILLILITER BEAKER TO
THE 13 ML. LEVEL WITH FUMING RED NITRIC
ACID, OF 98% PURE CONCENTRATION.
 
     2. PLACE THE BEAKER IN AN ICE BATH
AND ALLOW TO COOL BELOW ROOM TEMP.
 
     3. AFTER IT HAS COOLED, ADD TO IT
THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF FUMING
SULFERIC ACID (99% H2SO4).  IN OTHER
WORDS, ADD TO THE NOW-COOL FUMING
NITRIC ACID 39 ML. OF FUMING SULFERIC
ACID.  WHEN MIXING ANY ACIDS, ALWAYS DO
IT SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY TO AVOID
SPLATTERING.
 
     4. WHEN THE TWO ARE MIXED, LOWER
THIER TEMP. BY ADDING MORE ICE TO THE
BATH, ABOUT 10-15 DEGREES CENTIGRADE.
(USE A MERCURY-OPERATED THERMOMETER)
 
     5. WHEN THE ACID SOLUTION HAS
COOLED TO THE DESIRED TEMPERATURE, IT
IS READY FOR THE GLYCERIN. THE GLYCERIN
MUST BE ADDED IN SMALL AMOUNTS USING A
MEDICINE DROPPER.  (READ THIS STEP
ABOUT 10 TIMES!)  GLYCERIN IS ADDED
SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY (I MEAN CAREFUL!)
UNTIL THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE ACID IT
COVERED WITH IT.
 
     6. THIS IS A DANGEROUS POINT SINCE
THE NITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE AS SOON
AS THE GLYCERIN IS ADDED. THE NITRATION
WILL PRODUCE HEAT, SO THE SOLUTION MUST
BE KEPT BELOW 30 DEGREES CENTIGRADE! IF
THE SOLUTION SHOULD GO ABOVE 30
DEGREES,  IMMEDIATELY DUMP THE SOLUTION
INTO THE ICE BATH!  THIS WILL INSURE
THAT IT DOES NOT GO OFF IN YOUR FACE!
 
     7. FOR HTE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF
NITRATION, THE MIXTURE SHOULD BE GENTLY
STIRRED.  IN A NORMAL REACTION THE
NITROGLYCERIN WILL FORMAS A LAYER ON
TOP OF THE ACID SOLUTION, WHILE THE
SULFERIC ACID WILL ABSORB THE EXCESS
WATER.
 
     8. AFTER THE NITRATION HAS TAKEN
PLACE, AND THE NITROGLYCERIN HAS FORMED
ON THE TOP OF THE SOLUTION, THE ENTIRE
BEAKER SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED SLOWLY AND
CAREFULLY TO ANOTHER BEAKER OF WATER.
WHEN THIS IS DONE THE NITROGLYCERIN
WILL SETTLE AT THE BOTTEM SO THE OTHER
ACIDS CAN BE DRAINED AWAY.
 
     9. AFTER REMOVING AS MUCH ACID AS
POSIBLE WITHOUT DISTURBING THE
NITROGLYCERIN, REMOVE THE NITROGLYCERIN
WITH AN EYEDROPPER AND PLACE IT IN A
BICARBONATE OF SODA (SODIUM BICARBONATE
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW) SOLUTION. THE
SODIUM IS AN ALKALAI AND WILL
NUETRALIZE MUCH OF THE ACID REMAINING.
THIS PROCESS SHOULD BE REPEATED AS MUCH
AS NECESARRY USING BLUE LITMUS PAPER TO
CHECK FOR THE PRESENCE OF ACID. THE
REMAINING ACID ONLY MAKES THE NITROGLY-
CERIN MORE UNSTABLE THAN IT ALREADY
IS.
 
     10. FINALLY! THE FINAL STEP IS TO
REMOVE THE NITROGLYCERIN FROM THE BI-
CARBONATE.  HIS IS DONE WITH AND EYE-
DROPPER, SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY.  THE
USUAL TEST TO SEE IF NITRATION HAS BEEN
SUCCESSFUL IS TO PLACE ONE DROP OF THE
NITROGLYCERIN ON METAL AND IGNITE IT.
IF IT IS TRUE NITROGLYCERIN IT WILL
BURN WITH A CLEAR BLUE FLAME.
 
** CAUTION **
NITRO IS VERY SENSATIVE TO DECOMPOSI-
TION, HEATING DROPPING, OR JARRING, AND
MAY EXPLODE IF LEFT UNDISTURBED AND
COOL.

  How to Make and Use Nitroglycerin.

(How Nitro explodes--note that the
byproducts are nothing but nitrogen,
carbon dioxide, water and oxygen)
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
     Nitroglycerin [heretofore
Nitro] is a very powerful high-
explosive.  I am not sure who
invented it but he probably didn't--
the first person to make it
probably blew himself up and his
freind got the info off his notes.
Well anyway, the next best thing to
Nitro is TNT which is ten times
harder to make but also ten times
safer to make.  If you can't use
common sense then dont even TRY
to make this stuff--a few drops can
blow off your hand in the right
circumstances.
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
     To make Nitro:
     == ==== ======
 
     Mix 100 parts fuming nitric acid
(for best results it should have a
specific gravity of 50 degrees Baume')
with 200 parts sulphuric acid.  This
is going to be HOT at first--it won't
splatter if you pour the nitric INTO
the sulphuric but don't try it the
other way around.  The acid solutions
together can disolve flesh in a matter
of seconds so take the proper measures
for God's sake!!!  When cool, add 38
parts glycerine as slowly as possible.
Let it trickle down the sides of the
container into the acids or it won't
mix thourily and the reaction could
go to fast--which causes enough heat
to ignite the stuff.  Stir with a
**GLASS** rod for 15 seconds or so
then CARFULLY pour it into 20 times
it's *VOLUME* of water.  It will
visibly precipitate immediatly. there
will be twice as much Nitro as you
used glycerin and it is easy to
separate.  Mix it with baking soda
as soon as you have separated it--
this helps it not to go off
spontainously.
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
NOTES:  Parts are by weight nd he
Baume' scale of spicific gravity can
be found in most chem. books.  You
can get fuming nitric and sulfuric
acids wherever good chemicals or
fertilizers are sold.  It is
positivly *STUPID* to make more
than 200 grams of Nitro at a time.
When mixing the stuff wear goggles,
gloves, etc.  When I first made
the stuff I had the honor of having
it go off by itself (I added too
much glycerine at a time.)  I was
across the room at the time, but
I felt the impact--so did the table
it was on as well as the window it
was next to--they were both smashed
by only 25 grams in an open bowl.
Oh, yes, glycerine you can get at
any pharmacy and you need an adult
signature for the acids.  Any bump
can make Nitro go off if you don't
add the bicarbonate of (baking)
soda--but even with that, if it
gets old I wouldn't play catch with
it.
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
     Once you have made the Nitro and
saturated it with Bicarb. you can make
a really powerful explosive that won't
go off by itself by simply mixing it
with as much cotton as you can and
then saturating that with molten
(but as cool as possible, of course)
parifine--just enough to make it
sealed and hard.  Typically, use the
same amounts (by weight) of each
Nitro, cotton and parifine.  This,
when wrapped in newspaper, was once
known as "Norbin & Ohlsson's Patent
Dynamite," but that was back in 1896.

         Improvised Explosives

  Gelatine Explosive from Anti-Freeze

</>-<\>-</>-<\>-</>-<\>-</>-<\>-</>-<\>

Written by: The Lich

 This explosive is almost the same as the nitro-gelatin plastique
explosive
exept that it is supple and pliable to -10 to -20 deg. C..
Antifreeze is easier
to obtain than glycerine and is usually cheaper. It needs to be
freed of water
before the manufacture and this can be done by treating it with
calcium chlor-
ide until a specific gravity of 1.12 @ o deg. C. or 1.11 @ 20
deg. C. is
obtained. This can be done by adding calcium chloride to the
antifreeze and
checking with a hydrometer and continue to add calcium chloride
until the
proper reading is obtained. The antifreeze is then filtered to
remove the
calcium chloride from the liquid. This explosive is superior to
nitro-gelatin
in that it is easier to collidon the IMR smokeless powder into
the explosive
and that the 50/50 ether ethyl alcohol can be done away with. It
is superior
in that the formation of the collidon is done very rapidly by the
nitroethelene
glycol. It's detonation properties are practically the same as
the nitro-
gelatine. Like the nitro-gelatine it is highly flammable and if
caught on fire
the chances are good that the flame will progress to detonation.
In this
explosive as in nitro-gelatine the addition of 1% sodium
carbonate is a good
idea to reduce the chance of recidual acid being present in the
final explos-
ive. The following is a slightly different formula than
nitro-gelatine:

Nitro-glycol            75%
Guncotton (IMR)          6%
Potassium Nitrate       14%
Flour (baking)           5%

 In this process the 50/50 step is omitted. Mix the potassium
nitrate with the
nitro-glycol. Remember that this nitro-glycol is just as
sensitive to shock as
is nitroglycerin. The next step is to mix in the flour and sodium
carbonate.
Mix these by kneading with gloved hands until the mixture is
uniform. This
kneading should be done gently and slowly. The mixture should be
uniform when
the IMR smokeless powder is added. Again this is kneaded to
uniformity. Use
this explosive as soon as possible. If it must be stored, store
in a cool, dry
place (0-10 deg. C.). This explosive should detonate at 7600-7800
m/sec.. These
two explosives are very powerful and should be sensitive to a #6
blasting cap
or equivelent. These explosives are dangerous and should not be
made unless the
manufacturer has had experience with this type compound. The
foolish and ignor-
ant may as well forget these explosives as they won't live to get
to use them.
Don't get me wrong, these explosives have been manufactured for
years with an
amazing record of safety. Millions of tons of nitroglycerine have
been made and
used to manufacture dynamite and explosives of this nature with
very few mis-
haps. Nitroglycerin and nitroglycol will kill and their main
victims are the
stupid and foolhardy. Before manufacturing these explosives take
a drop of
nitroglycerin and soak into a small piece of filter paper and
place it on an
anvil. Hit this drop with a hammer and don't put any more on the
anvil. See
what I mean! This explosive compound is not to be taken lightly.
If there are
any doubts DON'T.

         Improvised Explosives

    Plastique Explosive from Aspirin

</>-<\>-</>-<\>-</>-<\>-</>-<\>-</>-<\>

Written by: The Lich

 This explosive is a phenol dirivative. It is toxic and explosive
compounds
made from picric acid are poisonous if inhaled, ingested, or
handled and absor-
bed through the skin. The toxicity of this explosive restrict's
its use due to
the fact that over exposure in most cases causes liver and kidney
failure and
sometimes death if immediate treatment is not obtained.

 This explosive is a cousin to T.N.T. but is more powerful than
it's cousin. It
is the first explosive used militarily and was adopted in 1888 as
an artillery
shell filler. Originally this explosive was derived from coal tar
but thanx to
modern chemistry you can make this explosive easily in
approximately three
hours from acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin purified).

 This procedure involves dissolving the acetylsalicylic acid in
warm sulfuric
acid and adding sodium or potassium nitrate which nitrates the
purified aspirin
and the whole mixture drowned in water and filtered to obtain the
final pro-
duct. This explosive is called trinitrophenol. Care should be
taken to ensure
that this explosive is stored in glass containers. Picric acid
will form dang-
erous salts when allowed to contact all metals exept tin and
aluminum. These
salts are primary explosive and are super sensitive. They also
will cause the
detonation of the picric acid.

 To make picric acid obtain some aspirin. The cheaper brands work
best but
buffered brands should be avoided. Powder these tablets to a fine
consistancy.
To extract the acetylsalicylic acid from this powder place this
powder in
methyl alcohol and stir vigorously. Not all of the powder will
dissolve. Filter
this powder out of the alcohol. Again wash this powder that was
filtered out of
the alcohol with more alcohol but with a lesser amount than the
first extrac-
tion. Again filter the remaining powder out of the alcohol.
Combine the now
clear alcohol and allow it to evaporate in a pyrex dish. When the
alcohol has
evaporated there will be a surprising amount of crystals in the
bottom of the
pyrex dish.

 Take fourty grams of these purified acetylsalicylic acid
crystals and dissolve
them in 150 ml. of sulfuric acid (98%, specify gravity 1.8) and
heat to diss-
olve all the crystals. This heating can be done in a common
electric frying
pan with the thermostat set on 150 deg. F. and filled with a good
cooking oil.
When all the crystals have dissolved in the sulfuric acid take
the beaker, that
you've done all this dissolving in (600 ml.), out of the oil
bath. This next
step will need to be done with a very good ventilation system (it
is a good
idea to do any chemistry work such as the whole procedure and any
procedure on
this disk with good ventilation or outside). Slowly start adding
58 g. of
sodium nitrate or 77 g. of potassium nitrate to te acid mixture
in the beaker
very slowly in small portions with vigorous stirring. A red gas
(nitrogen tri-
oxide) will be formed and this should be avoided. The mixture is
likely to
foam up and the addition should be stopped until the foaming goes
down to
prevent the overflow of the acid mixture in the beaker. When the
sodium or
potassium nitrate has been added the mixture is allowed to cool
somewhat (30-
40 deg. C.). The solution should then be dumped slowly into twice
it's volume
of crushed ice and water. The brilliant yellow crystals will form
in the water.
These should be filtered out and placed in 200 ml. of boiling
distilled water.
This water is allowed to cool and then the crystals are then
filtered out of
the water. These crystals are a very, very pure trinitrophenol.
These crystals
are then placed in a pyrex dish and places in an oil bath and
heated to 80 deg.
C. and held there for 2 hours. This temperature is best
maintained and checked
with a thermometer. The crystals are then powdered in small
quantities to a
face powder consistency. These powdered crystals are then mixed
with 10% by
weight wax and 5% vaseline which are heated to melting
temperature and poured
into the crystals. The mixing is best done by kneading together
with gloved
hands. This explosive should have a useful plsticity range of
0-40 deg. C.. The
detonation velocity should be around 7000 m/sec.. It is toxic to
handle but
simply made from common ingredients and is suitable for most
demolition work
requiring a moderately high detonation velocity. It is very
suitable for
shaped charges and some steel cutting charges. It is not as good
an explosive
as C-4 or other R.D.X. based explosives but it is much easier to
make. Again
this explosive is very toxic and should be treated with great
care. AVOID
HANDLING BARE-HANDED, BREATHING DUST AND FUMES, AVOID ANY CHANCE
OF INGESTION.
AFTER UTENSILS ARE USED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS EXPLOSIVE
RETIRE THEM FROM
THE KITCHEN AS THE CHANCE OF POISONING IS NOT WORTH THE RISK.
THIS EXPLOSIVE,
IF MANUFACTURED AS ABOVE, AHOULD BE SAFE IN STORAGE BUT WITH ANY
HOMEMADE
EXPLOSIVE STORAGE OS NOT RECOMENDED AND EXPLOSIVES SHOULD BE MADE
UP AS NEEDED.

    Plastique Explosive from Bleach

</>-<\>-</>-<\>-</>-<\>-</>-<\>-</>-<\>

Written by: The Lich

 This explosive is a potassium chlorate explosive. This explosive
and explo-
sives of similar composition were used in World War II as the
main explosive
filler in gernades, land mines, and mortar used by French,
German, and other
forces involoved in that conflict. These explosives are
relatively safe to
manufacture. One should strive to make sure these explosives are
free of
sulfur, sulfides, and picric acid. The presence of these
compounds result in
mixtures that are or can become highly sensitive and possibly
decompose ex-
plosively while in storage. The manufacture of this explosive
from bleach is
given as just an expediant method. This method of manufacturing
potassium
chlorate is not economical due to the amount of energy used to
boil the sol-
ution and cause the 'dissociation' reaction to take place. This
procedure does
work and yields a relatively pure and a sulfur/sulfide free
product. These
explosives are very cap sensitive and require only a #3 cap for
instigating
detonation. To manufacture potassium chlorate from bleach (5.25%
sodium
hypochlorite solution) obtain a heat source (hot plate stove
etc.) a battery
hydrometer, a large pyrex or enameled steel container (to weigh
chemicals),
and some potassium chloride (sold as salt substitute). Take one
gallon of
bleach, place it in the container and begin heating it. While
this solution
heats, weigh out 63 g. potassium chloride and add this to the
bleach being
heated. Bring this solution to a boil and boiled until when
checked by a
hydrometer the reading is 1.3 (if a battery hydrometer is used it
should read
full charge).

 When the reading is 1.3 take the solution and let it cool in the
refrigerator
until it's between room temperature and 0 deg. C.. Filter out the
crystals that
have formed and save them. Boil the solution again until it reads
1.3 on the
hydrometer and again cool the solution. Filter out the crystals
that have
formed and save them. Boil this solution again and cool as
before. Filter and
save the crystals. Take these crystals that have been saved and
mix them with
distilled water in the following proportions: 56 g. per 100 ml.
distilled
water. Heat this solution until it boils and allow it to cool.
Filter the
solution and save the crystals that form upon cooling. The
process if purifi-
cation is called fractional crystalization. These crystals should
be relatively
pure potassium chlorate.

 Powder these to the consistency of face powder (400 mesh) and
heat gently to
drive off all moisture. Melt five parts vasoline and five parts
wax. Dissolve
this in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline) and pour this liquid
on 90 parts
potassium chlorate (the crystals from the above operation) in a
plastic bowl.
Knead this liquid into the potassium chlorate until immediately
mixed. Allow
all the gasoline to evaporate. Place this explosive in a cool,
dry place. Avoid
friction, sulfur, sulfide, and phosphorous compounds. This
explosive is best
molded to the desired shape and density (1.3g./cc.) and dipped in
wax to water
proof. These block type charges guarantee the highest detonation
velocity. This
explosive is really not suited to use in shaped charge
applications due to its
relatively low detonation velocity. It is comparable to 40%
ammonia dynamite
and can be considered the same for the sake of charge
computation. If the
potassium chlorate is bought and not made it is put into the
manufacture pro-
cess in the powdering stages preceding the addition of the
wax/vaseline mix-
ture. This explosive is bristant and powerful. The addition of
2-3% aluminum
powder increases its blast effect. Detonation velocity is 3300
m/sec..

Written by: The Lich

 This explosive is a chlorate explosive from bleach. This method
of production
of potassium or sodium chlorate is easier and yields a more pure
product than
does the plastique explosive from bleach process. In this
reaction the H.T.H.
(calcium hypochlorite CaC10) is mixed with water and heated with
either sodium
chloride (table salt, rock salt) or potassium chloride (salt
substitute). The
latter of these salts is the salt of choice due to the easy
crystalization of
the potassium chlorate. This mixture will need to be boiled to
ensure complete
reaction of the ingredients. Obtain some H.T.H. swimming pool
chlorination
compound or equivilant (usually 65% calcium hypochlorite). As
with the bleach
process mentioned earlier the reaction described below is also a
dissociation
reaction. In a large pyrex glass or enamled steel container place
1200g. H.T.H.
and 220g. potassium chloride or 159g. sodium chloride. Add enough
boiling water
to dissolve the powder and boil this solution. A chalky substance
(calcium
chloride) will be formed. When the formation of this chalky
substance is no
longer formed the solution is filtered while boiling hot. If
potassium chloride
was used potassium chlorate will be formed. This potassium
chlorate will drop
out or crystalize as the clear liquid left after filtering cools.
These
crystals are filtered out when the solution reaches room
temperature. If the
sodium chloride salt was used this clear filtrate (clear liquid
after filter-
ation) will need to have all water evaporated. This will leave
crystals which
should be saved.

 These crystals should be heated in a slightly warm oven in a
pyrex dish to
drive off all traces of water (40-75 deg. C.). These crystals are
ground to a
very fine powder (400 mesh).

 If the sodium chloride salt is used in the initial step the
crystalization is
much more time consuming. The potassium chloride is the salt to
use as the
resulting product will crystalize out of the solution as it
cools. The powdered
and completely dry chlorate crystals are kneaded together with
vaseline in a
plastic bowl. ALL CHLORATE BASED EXPLOSIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO
FRICTION AND SHOCK
AND THESE SHOULD BE AVOIDED. If sodium chloride is used in this
explosive it
will have a tendancy to cake and has a slightly lower detonation
velocity. This
explosive is composed of the following:

   potassium/sodium chlorate    90%
   vaseline                     10%

 The detonation velocity can be raised to a slight extent by the
addition of
2-3% aluminum sunstituted for 2-3% of the vaseline. This addition
of this
aluminum will give the explosive a bright flash if set off at
night which will
ruin night vision for a short while. The detonation velocity of
this explosive
is approximately 3200 m/sec. for the potassium salt and 2900
m/sec. for the
sodium salt based explosive.

This isn't a death and Destruction file. I'm not telling losers how to cause
thermite reactions in chemistry class or make neeto pipe bombs to blow up that
guy who keeps bugging you.
This is from a book by George Hayduke.  It describes a variety of ways to get
back at people who cause you distress.  The book has contains a lot of tips on
causing expensive damage to "marks". Well, I picked the good ones. Ones that
don't cause a lot of expense, in currency that is. Well, I hope you enjoy.
Get back at the losers using the system. Sort of like piracy and phreaking.
***************************************
In a car with automatic transmission, switch the #1 and #8 wires on the
distributer cap. This will allegedly allow the car to operate in Neutral and
Park, but the engine mysteriously dies in Drive.
Castor Oil squirted into the tailpipe of a car, will cause a large amount of
smoke. Just the thing to help nervous drivers.
If you can get a bank account number for a person, truly wonderful things can
happen. Depositing one penny every day can get the employees very pissed.
It happens that given a few hundred wanted posters, one will look like you. OR
anybody else you can imagine. Close anyway. Think of all the bounty hunters
just waiting to claim their reward.
Place an ad in a paper for Male Secretarys only. $11 an hour, must be
physically attractive, gentle, and other related social traits.  This is for 
anybody who has an office. Give the time to show up one half hour before
the normal opening hour. For example, if the office opens at 9:00, put the time
to be 8:30. All these faggots will show up and start bitching at each other and
your loser.
Run an ad in the local paper with the following message.
"I need all used christmas trees. Please leave them on my lawn, and I'll pay
$5 for each one." then leave the losers address. The paper will take your $
and print the ad without thinking.
If you know the guy is going to throw a party, arrange for him to find out that
somebody was going to crash his party, dressed up like cops. Then call the cops
telling them of a real rowdy party going on.
If your college uses computers to handle admissions, try this. Fill out course
withdrawl forms in the losers name. Then enter them, they probably won't check.
The guy will go the entire block unknowing, then when grades are posted. 
"Where are mine?" "Why didn't I get grades?"
Call your colleges administration, tell them you are the undertaker of your
losers hometown. He just died, please take him off your records, records will
follow. Then call the parents. He just died in a fraternity accident. This will
work better if the guy decides to skip a week or so of classes.
Instead of credit card fraud, just call up the company and tell them that you
just lost your cards. You name? Why it's (insert loser)
If you want, advertise the losers phone number as a Dial A Joke. For bigots,
Dial A Black, etc.
If you dislike a fast food place with a drive thru, try this. Order everything
you can think of. Then just don't go to the window. Do it during dinner hours.
Or, order a normal sized meal, but with extra helpings of mustard. Then the
next car will try the food, then freak out at the joint.
Garage door openers often have dip switches that can be changed to other
combinations. The cheaper the model, the better. Sears sells just the unit.
Say you broke yours or something. Then change the settings.
Wax crayons tossed into a wash do wonders to whites or anything else.
 
There is a whole section of phun things to do with a phone.
Call in a bomb threat to a school or something, then leave the handset offhook.
Of course, do this only at the losers house. Someone will visit.
Call Ma Bell, and report that your loser is using Blue Boxes. Tell them it is 
your civic duty... Don't do this to someone who knows what they are though.
The phone co doesn't believe in innocence. 
Ads placed in papers saying that (insert loser) will sell YOU! the plans to a
device enabling inexpensive calls. Mention that you keep no records.
If you are getting back at somebody with a multi-line system, this is good.
Place a large magnet where the line comes in. When one phone rings, they all do
If you can get a private minute with your marks phone, and the handset is 
modular, cover the handset plug with clear nail polish. The phone rings, then
its unlimited "Hello?" "Hello?"
Remove the pins from all but one of the hinges of a front door of a business.
The door will work fine, for a while, then fall off. People start screaming.
Add luminescent paint into the cans of someone who is painting their fence.
Then, at night, it glows.
Get some copper paint and paint a small line across the insulator of a spark
plug in a car. They'll never find it.
If your loser gets a parking ticket, get it before he sees it. Then get a stamp
flicking the cops off. Send it in with no money.
If you dislike a pet hater, here's one.
Advertise that you(the loser) wuold like to buy all unwanted strays. $10 for
each one. Then call the SPCA, telling them that the loser wants the animals to
conduct black masses and pagan rites.
Laxatives slipped into dogfood does wonders.
Or better yet, toss some normal meat into the dog-owners yard. Then call him
up(in a disguised voice) and tell him you saw a suspicious person hanging
around the yard....
Mail a letter to the Chief Executive detailing the sexual acts you(the loser)
would like to commit, the Secret Service investigates this with no humor.
PA systems in department stores are great. Just walk up to a deserted unit,
look around, then deliver the most disgusting statement you can think of.
Call about thirty people, telling them they just won a sweepstakes. Answer the
questions, no obligation, it's just to show how generous people are. Then give
the losers phone number to call for more info.
Remember two things, hot metal and hot glass do not look different from cool.
(as long as it's not too hot)
Western Telegram has a check on everything going through. Certain key words
trip alarms. Guns, Drugs, Sex, Terrorist, etc all ring bells. Have fun

   How to Make and Use Nitroglycerin.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
CH2ONO2
!                    3/2 N2 + 3 CO2
CHONO2  ---------->     +
!        Ignition    5/2 H2O + 1/4 O2
CH2ONO2
 
(How Nitro explodes--note that the
byproducts are nothing but nitrogen,
carbon dioxide, water and oxygen)
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
     Nitroglycerin [heretofore
Nitro] is a very powerful high-
explosive.  I am not sure who
invented it but he probably didn't--
the first person to make it
probably blew himself up and his
freind got the info off his notes.
Well anyway, the next best thing to
Nitro is TNT which is ten times
harder to make but also ten times
safer to make.  If you can't use
nse then dont even TRY
to make this stuff--a few drops can
bbcircumstances.
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
     To make Nitro:
     == ==== ======
 
     Mix 100 parts fuming nitric acid
(for best results it should have a
specific gravity of 50 degrees Baume')
with 200 parts sulphuric acid.  This
is going to be HOT at first--it won't
splatter if you pour the nitric INTO
the sulphuric but don't try it the
other way around.  The acid solutions
together can disolve flesh in a matter
of seconds so take the proper measures
for God's sake!!!  When cool, add 38
parts glycerine as slowly as possible.
Let it trickle down the sides of the
container into the acids or it won't
mix thourily and the reaction could
go to fast--which causes enough heat
to ignite the stuff.  Stir with a
**GLASS** rod for 15 seconds or so
then CARFULLY pour it into 20 times
it's *VOLUME* of water.  It will
visibly precipitate immediatly. there
will be twice as much Nitro as you
used glycerin and it is easy to
separate.  Mix it with baking soda
as soon as you have separated it--
this helps it not to go off
spontainously.
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
  NOTES:  Parts are by weight and the
Baume' scale of spicific gravity can
be found in most chem. books.  You
can get fuming nitric and sulfuric
acids wherever good chemicals or
fertilizers are sold.  It is
positivly *STUPID* to make more
than 200 grams of Nitro at a time.
When mixing the stuff wear goggles,
gloves, etc.  When I first made
the stuff I had the honor of having
it go off by itself (I added too
much glycerine at a time.)  I was
across the room at the time, but
I felt the impact--so did the table
it was on as well as the window it
was next to--they were both smashed
by only 25 grams in an open bowl.
Oh, yes, glycerine you can get at
any pharmacy and you need an adult
signature for the acids.  Any bump
can make Nitro go off if you don't
add the bicarbonate of (baking)
soda--but even with that, if it
gets old I wouldn't play catch with
it.
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
     Once you have made the Nitro and
saturated it with Bicarb. you can make
a really powerful explosive that won't
go off by itself by simply mixing it
with as much cotton as you can and
then saturating that with molten
((parifine--just enough to make it
sealed and hard.  Typically, use the
same amounts (by weight) of each
Nitro, cotton and parifine.  This,
when wrapped in newspaper, was once
known as "Norbin & Ohlsson's Patent
Dynamite," but that was back in 1896.

                              Car Thrashing
     Written by:              ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~                         Call:
     Mr. "Budman" Zeek                                   (503) 253 - 5300
(*-> -------------------------------------------------------------------- <-*)

     There are many ways to thrash someones car. But they basicly fall under
    2 topics. These are, 1 to just fuck it up and 2, to distroy it. As long
    as your at it don't for get to steal the stero & speakers.

     The following are type 1 tricks to pull of on someones car.

Sweet-Gas:  This involves taking the gas cap off of you victums car. If it
---------  is a locking cap break it off. Or you might pry it off, resort to
 "Jocky Boxin" by Mr. Zeek if un fimiler with these tecniqes. Once you have
 the gas cap off pour 4 or 5 pounds of white sugar in there gas tank. Now
 when the start there car up and drive away they will go about 2 miles or so
 then the car will crap out and they will have to pay some $'s to get it fixed.

Sweet-Oil:   In this one you open there hood and pour some honey in there oil
---------  spout. if yu have time you might remover the oil plug first and
  drain some of the oil out. I have tried this one but wasn't around to see the
  effects but I am sure that I did some damage.

Slow Air:   Ok, sneak yp the victums car and poke a small hole some where
--------  in 2 of his/her tires. They only have 1 spare. Now if the hole is
  small but there then there tire will go flat some where on the road. You
  could slice the tire so this is blows out on the road wih a rasor blade.
  Cut a long and fairly deep (don't cut a hole) and peel a little bit of the
  rubber back and cut that off. Now very soon there tires will go flat or a
  possible blow out at a high speed if your lucky.

Vanishing Paint:   Spead a little gas or paint thiner on the victums car
---------------  and this will make his paint run and fade. Vodca will eat
  the paint off and so will a little 190. Eggs work great on pain if they
  sit there long enough.

Key Paint:   Run you car keys/can opener along there car and scrach a long
---------  strip off. It'll really piss 'em off and everyone can see it.

All-Lock:   You go up to the dudes car, right. And then super glue the
--------   the door lock and door handle where the car can't be opened.

Loose Wheel:   Losen the lugs on you victums tires so that they will soon
-----------   fall off. This can really fuck some one up if they are cruzing
when the tire falls off.


Ok, thats some of the begginer shit...now if your really out to get this dude
try some of these....

 First, pause and take a bong hit...........


  No name for this one. but where you pour oil into the engin, pour some
sand, this will scar the head and pushrodes and possible scrach the fuck out
of the cylinder.

Dual Nutral:  This name sucks but pull the 10 bolt or what ever they have
-----------  there off. (On the real wheels, in the middle of the axle) Now
  throw some screws, blots, nuts and assorted things in there and replace
  the cover. At this point you could chip some of the teeth off the gears.

Un-Midaser:  Crawl under there car with a rachet and losen all the nuts 
----------  on there exauset so that it hangs low and will fall off soon.
  They will be in town and there exaust will fall off. This method also
  works on tranys but is a little harder to get all bolts off, but the
  harder you work the more you fuck them over.

Draino Bomb:   (Idea from Baby Demon) Get a little plasistc orange thingy
-----------   that you get from you local drugest. And fill this with liquid
draino. Now re-cap and place inside vicuum gas tank. When the gs easts
through the plasic...look out. this has not been tried by anyone that I
personly know. But what the well, your a terrorists

(*-> Another way is to get a ping-pong ball and cut a small hole in it, now
  fill the ball up with liquid dranio and seal the hold with tape. Now drop
  the ball in someone gas tank and n about 40secs...BOOM!


 
(*->   Well, for all you hard working terriorsts, this BUD is for you.    <-*)

HOW TO MAKE A REALLY NICE PIPE BOMB OUT OF EVERYDAY MATERIALS.
UPLOADED BY THE GRAY MOUSER.....
 
1) GO TO YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND TELL THE GUY THAT IS HELPING YOU
THAT YOU WANT A PIECE OF STEEL PIPE ONE FOOT LONG. AND ALSO THAT YOU WANT
THE ENDS THREADED AND YOU ALSO WANT CAPS TO PUT ON THE END.
 
2) NOW GET AHOLD OF A BABYFOOD JAR. MAKE SURE THAT THE JAR WILL FIT DOWN
THE PIPE REAL EASY LIKE. FILL THE BABYJAR WITH EVERYDAY VINEGAR. MAKE
SURE THE TOP IS SCREWED ON REAL TIGHT. **IF IT IS LOOSE YOU WILL BLOW YOUR
HAND OFF**
 
3)NOW CAP ONE END OF YOUR PIPE WITH ONE OF THE CAPS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
PICKED UP WITH THE PIPE. IF YOU KNOW OF SOMEONE WITH A WIELDER, HAVE HIM
WIELD A BEAD AROUND THE THREADS AFTER YOU HAVE IT CAPPED.
 
4)PUT SOME SMALL SHARP ROCKS DOWN THE END OF THE PIPE AND THEN SLIDE THE
BABYJAR DOWN INSIDE SO THE GLASS END IS AGAINST THE LITTLE ROCKS. NOW
EMPTY A MEDIUM BOX OF ARM AND HAMMER BAKING SODA INTO THE PIPE. CAP THE
OTHER END OF THE PIPE AND IF YOU CAN WIELD IT, THEN GO FOR IT.
**BE FUCKING CAREFUL** YOU MIGHT BREAK THE JAR INSIDE AND YOU WON'T
KNOW THAT YOU BROKE IT UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR HAND FLY OFF!!!
 
5)NOW, WHEN YOU WANT TO BLOW SOMETHING UP, JUST SMACK THE END OF THE PIPE 
THAT SENDS THE JAR INSIDE DOWN AGAINST THE SMALL ROCKS. OH YEAH, SMACK IT
AGAINST SOME CONCREAT. THIS BREAKS THE JAR AND THE VINEGAR AND BAKING
SODA MIX TOGETHER AND BUILDS UP PRESSURE. WHEN IT GETS TO THE 
CRITICAL POINT....WHAMMY!!!!
 
******IMPORTANT******
 
AFTER YOU HIT THE PIPE AGAINST THE GROUND, GET THE HELL RID OF IT!!!
TOSS IT INTO SOMEONES CAR OR SOMEWHERE. SOMETIMES. IT TAKES FIVE MINUTS FOR
IT TO GO OFF, SOMETIMES TWO. BUT IT WILL GO OFF! TRUST ME!
 
I DID THIS WHEN I WAS LIVING IN ARIZONA. MY FREIND THAT TAUGHT ME
THIS WAS A DEMOLITIONS EXPERT FOR THE NAVY.
 
THE FIRST TIME I DID IT. WE TOSSED THE PIPE INTO AN OLD HOUSE AND IT BLEW ALL FOUR WALLS OUT!! THE SECOND TIME WE DID IT, WE TOSSED IT INTO AN OLD CAR. AND IT PHUKING BLEW ALL FOUR DOORS OFF AND THE ROOF THREE FEET INTO THE AIR!!!!
 
WHEN WE BLEW UP THE HOUSE, WE WAITED FIVE MINUTS AND I THOUGHT THAT IT
WOULDN'T GO OFF. SO I CRAWLED OUT OF THE DITCH THAT WE WERE IN. WHAMMY!!
JUST THEN IT WENT OFF! IT THREW ME BACK FIVE FEET BACK INTO THE DITCH!
 
IF YOU FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS REAL CAREFULLY. THEN YOU WON'T GET HURT.
 
   I WILL TALK TO YOU ALL LATER. AND TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE BLOWN UP!!!

Ok. Heres a really simple bomb that you
can make from things you've probably go
t lying around the house... What you ne
eed:

A bag of fertilizer
Some Cotton
Some Starter Fluid (etherous kind)
Some Newspaper

Ok... You fold the newspaper until its
in sort of a pocket shape, then fill it
up with fertilizer (not too much).. Nex
t, you put cotton on top of the fertili
zer. Then, pour some starter fluid on i
t (the fertilizer), wrap up the newspap
er (you can use tape). Now this isnt th
e kind of bomb you leave lying around
for a couple days, as it drys out. When
you want to use it, just light the edge
of the newspaper and throw it. Pretty
simple, eh? 
Have Phun, and don't get caught!

When employing the use of any high explosive,an individual must also use some kind of detonating device.Blasting caps are probably the most popular today,since they are very functional and relativly stable.The prime ingrediant in most blasting caps and d
e
tonating devices in general is mercury fulminate.There are several methods for preparing mercury fulminate.

Method No.1 for the preparation of
      Mercury Fulminate:

1. Take 5 grams of pure mercury and mix is with 35 ml. of nitric acid.

2.The mixture is slowly and gentle heated.As soon as the solution bubbles and turns green, one knows that the silver mercury is dissolved.

3. After it is dissolved, the solution should be poured,slowly,into a small flask of ethyl alcohol.This will result in red fumes.

4. After a half hour or so,the red fumes will turn white, indicating that the process is nearing its final stage.

5. after a few minutes, add distilled water to the solution.

6. The entire solution is now filtered, in order to obtain the small white crystals.These crystals are pure mercury fulminate,but should be washed many times, and tested with litmus paper for any remaining undersiable acid.


  Method No. 2 for the preparation of
   Mercury Fulminate:

1. Mix one part mercuric oxide with ten parts ammonia solution.When ratios are described,they are always done according to weight rather than volume.

2. After waiting eight to ten days,one will see that the mercuric oxide has reacted with the ammonia solution to produce the white fulminate crystals.

3. These crystals must be handled in the same way as the first method described, in that they must be washed many times and given several litmus paper tests.

 



    Many other fulminates can be made in the same manner as above,but i will not go into these,since most are extremely unstable and sensitive to shock.All fulminates including mercury fulminate,are sensitive to shock and friction,and in no circumstances
 
should they be handled in a rough or careless manner..

HI, IT'S ME, THE GREMLIN AGAIN.  THIS TIME, I DECIDED TO WRITE ABOUT SOME
COOL WAYS TO KILL SOMEBODY YOU DON'T LIKE, AND HAVE A GOOD TIME LAUGHING
WHILE YOU DO IT.

..IF HEE RACES BMX, STRING A 60 POUND TEST LINE ACROSS A JUMP OR IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE TRACK...

..STAPLE HIS MOUTH TO THE TAIL-PIPE OF YOUR BMW, AND PUT A PIECE OF TAPE
ACROSS HIS NOSE, THEN DRIVE ABOUT 20 MILES AT TOP-SPEED, BY THIS TIME, HIS
MOUTH SHOULD BE ENMESHED WITH THE TAIL-PIPE, HIS KNUCKLES, KNEES, AND FEET
WILL BE PRACTICALLY NON-EXISTENT FROM DRAGGING ON THE GROUND, AND HE'LL BE
QUITE DEAD FROM INHALING ALL THAT CARBON MONOXIDE...

..MAKE CONCRETE BLOCKS OUT OF HIS HANDS, THEN HANG HIM FROM A BRIDGE ACROSS
A NOT TOO WELL TRAVELLED ROAD, BY HIS FEET.  SET HIM SWINGING, AND WAIT FOR
THE NEXT TRUCK OR VAN...

..HANG HIM SPREAD-EAGLE OFF A DIVING BOARD, WITH A WEIGHT TIED AROUND HIS
STOMACH.  IF THE BOARD IS LOW ENOUGH, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BOUNCE UP AND
DOWN ON THE BOARD, AND WATCH HIM DROWN SLOWLY...

..TIE A ROPE AROUND HIS NECK STRAIGHT UP TO THE TOP OF A SAIL ON A SAIL-
BOAT, AND STRAP HIS FEET TO THE FLOOR, STRAIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOAT.
EVERY TIME THE SAIL COMES AROUND, IT SHOULD HIT HIM QUITE HARD IN THE HEAD.
I RECOMMEND THIS ONLY FOR VERY WINDY DAYS...

..USE HIM AS A MARKER IN A GIANT SLALOM SKI RACE...

..SLIDE RAZOR BLADES ACROSS HIS BACK FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, THEN GIVE HIM
THE CHOICE OF SHOOTING HIMSELF IN THE HEAD, OR BEING THROWN IN A BATH-TUB
FULL OF GIN...

..TIE HIM UP SPREAD EAGLE IN FRONT OF A PITCHING MACHINE, IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE TIP OF HIS NOSE IS ABOUT 2 INCHES AWAY FROM THE BARELL...

..TIE HIM UP, AND HANDCUFF HIM.  THEN PUT HIS FINGERS IN BETWEEN THE TYPE-
HEAD OF AN OLD-FASHIONED TYPEWRITER, AND THE PAPER.  YOU MIGHT LIKE TYPING
OUT YOUR OPINIONS OF HIM, WHILE HE SUFFERS...

..TAKE A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS AND PUT THEM ON HIS FEET.  THEN STRAP A ROPE
BETWEEN THEM, SO YOU HOLD ON TO THE ROPE.  GO ON SPACE MOUNTAIN IN DISNEY-
LAND, AND DRAG HIM OFF THE BACK.  IF YOU GET TIRED OR SCARED, JUST LET GO,
IT'S ONLY 80 OR 90 FEET DOWN TO THE CONCRETE...

..STEAL ALL THE JACKS AT THE INDY 500, AND USE HIM AS A REPLACEMENT...

..IF HE HAPPENS TO BE A SADIST, PLUCK OFF HIS ARMS AND LEGS, JUST AS HE
PROBABLY DID TO FLIES...

..STRING UP HIS LOCKER, SO THAT WHEN HE OPENS IT UP, A MOUSE TRAP SNAPS
OUT AND GRABS HIM BY THE YOU-KNOW-WHAT...

..BURY HIM STANDING UP 8 FEET DEEP IN SAND, THEN MAKE A WIDER AREA AROUND
HIS HEAD ABOUT 2 FEET DEEP.  PRY HIS EYES OPEN WITH SOMETHING (PREFERABLY
INFECTIOUS) AND POUR IN SALT.  THEN LET IN SIX RATS, AND WATCH THEM GOUGE
OUT HIS EYES FOR FOOD...

..TIE RUBBER-BANDS AROUND HIS ANKLES (REALLY STRONG AND LONG ONES MUST BE
USED FOR THIS, ABOUT 10 FEET LONG) AND GO UP ON TOP OF A HIGH DIVE, THAT
IS SHORTER THAN THE SOMEWHAT EXTENDED LENGTH OF THE RUBBER-BANDS.  USE
HIM AS A YO-YO...

..STRING HIM OUT ACROSS THE TRACK AT THE NEXT SUMMER OLYMPICS RIGHT BEFORE
THE MENS 100 METER DASH, IN PLACE OF THE RIBBON...

..GET ALL DRESSED UP IN A RADIATION SUIT, AND DRIVE OUT TO THREE MILE
ISLAND OR SOME OTHER NUCLEAR TEST THAT FAILED ITS' SAFETY TEST.  FIND A HUGE
VAT OF ANYTHING THAT LOOKS DANGEROUS, IS BOILING, OR IS MADE OF A COLOR
NATURE NEVER KNEW EXISTED.  THEN GRAB HIM BY THE ANKLES (LIKE ACHILLES'
MOTHER DID) AND DUNK HIM IN IT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES...

I JUST RAN OUT OF IDEAS.  IF YOU GOT OFFENDED BY THIS TOUGH SHIT IT'S A JOKE
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY THEN SCREW YOU.  IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE
IDEAS, LEAVE ME MAIL.

Recipe:

Mix 170 parts tolulene with 100 parts acid.  The acid made of 2 parts of 70%
nitric and 3 parts of 100% sulfuric.  Mix below 30 degrees. Set this down for
30 min. and let it separate. Take the mononitrotolulene and mix 100 part of it
with 215 parts of acid. This acid is 1 part pure nitric and 2 parts pure
sulfuric. Keep the temperature at 60- 70 degrees while they are slowly mixed.
Raise temp to 90-100 and stir for 30 min.  The dinitrotoluene is separated and
mix 100 parts of this stuff with 225 parts of 20% oleum which is 100% sulfuric
with 20% extra dissolved sulfur trioxide, and 65 parts nitric acid.  Heat at
95 degrees for 60 min.  Then at 120 degrees for 90 min.

Separate the trinitrotoluene and slosh it around in hot water. Purify the
powder by soaking it in benzyne.

                           Presto!  American Dynamite!

=-=-=-=-=-=  caused by information obtained from this text-file.  As a matter
             of fact, I'll let you sue me and I'll pay.  All you have to do is
             tell your lawyer, "It's all THE REFLEX's fault."  I'll see you
             when you get out of the institution.


    Some Militants who don't have much dynamite use ammonium nitrate.  This
can be bought by anyone at $3.75 for and 80 pound bag.  It is fertilizer.

     Ammonium nitrate explodes at rates up to 14,000 feet per second.  It is
roughly compared to dynamite having 60% nitro.

     The fertilizer grade Militants use is mixed with motor oil at the ratio of
one pint of oil to 8-1/2 pounds of ammonium nitrate.  This has to be detonated
with a stick of gelatin dynamite [I didn't say all was easy.  Try to find
another file about that crap.].

     Purified ammonium nitrate can be detonated with a number six dynamite cap.
The pure stuff can be bought at chemical supply houses or the fertilizer grade
can be purified with distilled wood alcohol.

     Put several pounds of fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in a pan.  Pour in
enough wood alcohol (methanol) to cover the fertilizer.  Then stir it until a
lot of it has dissolved.  Next, let it set for a few minutes to allow the
impurities to settle to the bottom along with the undissolved ammonium nitrate.

     Another pan is set on some pieces of dry ice for the next step.  Dry ice
can be found in the business section of the phone book under "Dry Ice."  Locker
companies will sell it to anyone, cheaply and in small amounts.

     The dissolved ammonium nitrate is poured into the cold pan.  This is done
carefully so as to leave the impurities and undissolved ammonium nitrate
behind.

     The dry ice causes the purified ammonium nitrate to precipitate out of the
solution in crystals.  When no more crystals are formed they are removed from
the alcohol.

     The alcohol is then poured back into the other pan and stirred to dissolve
any ammonium nitrate left undissolved.  After setting a few minutes the
solution is again poured off the dregs and the dregs are thrown away.  When the
last batch of crystals is removed, the alcohol can be stored and reused.

     The dry ice is simply frozen carbon dioxide and its fumes are harmless
unless they are enough to replace the air.  Don't handle the dry ice with your
bare hands [unless you are into pulling your skin off to the bone] as its cold
will cause blisters.

     In order for pure ammonium nitrate to be detonated by a dynamite cap, it
must be very dry.  Spread it out under a heat lamp ir in thte sun.  When
completely dry, store it in tightly closed plastic bags.

     You got here on just the right day!  For a limited time only, we will be
offering this *BONUS* file to you free with the above file.  That's right!  Two
files for the price of one!  And only from Omnipotent!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So you don't know what to do with your ammonium nitrate once you've made
it.  You're saying to yourself, "Great!  Now I have a chemical that is supposed
to blow things up, but I don't want to destroy anything [ahem?]."  Well...

                              LAUGHING GAS
                              =-=-=-=-=-=-
                               [snicker!]

     As a special treat for the dopers in the audience and since ammonium
nitrate has been on your mind for a few minutes, you might as well learn how to
make laughing gas from ammonium nitrate.

     Laughing gas was one of the earliest anaesthetics.  After a little while
of inhaling the gas the patient became so happy [ain't life great?] he couldn't
keep from laughing.  Finally he would drift off to a pleasant sleep.

     Some do-it-yourselfers have died while taking laughing gas.  This is
because they has generated it through plastic bags while their heads were
inside.  They were simply suffocating but were too bombed out to realize it.

     The trick is to have a plastic clothes bag in which you generate a lot of
the gas.  Then you stop generating the gas and hold a small opening of the bag
under your nose, getting plenty of oxygen in the meantime.  Then, Whee!

     To make it you start with ammonium nitrate bought from a chemical supply
house or which you have purified with 100% rubbing or wood alcohol.

     First, dissolve a quantity of ammonium nitrate in some water.  Then you
evaporate the water over the stove, while stirring, until you have a heavy
brine.  When nearly all the moisture is out it should solidify instantly when a
drop is put on an ice cold metal plate.

     When ready, dump it all out on a very cold surface.  After a while, break
it up and store it in a bottle.

     A spoonful is put into a flask with a one-hole stopper, with a tube
leading into a big plastic bag.  The flask is heated with an alcohol lamp.

     When the temperature in the flask reaches 480 F the gas will generate.  If
white fumes appear the heat should be lowered as the stuff explodes at 600 F.

     When the bag is filled, stop the action and get ready to turn on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, there you have two files in one.  No need to thank us.  Just send
all "donations" to...  [In this business, a since of humor is necessary!]

Until the next one...THE REFLEX signing off as I am getting tired.

I changed my mind, I'll post how to
make AFPO first. AFPO is the most
commonly manufactured blasting agent
in the world today, it far surpasses
dynamite. HERES HOW TO MAKE IT;

NEEDED;

Amononium Hydroxide (again)

Fuel Oil(s)(white gasoline works)

Gelitin(no, NOT FLAVORED!)

Mix the AH with the FUEL OIL, until
very thoughly mixed in to a thin
liquid, then add the GELITIN, yes,
this is a gel explosive, until you
feel it's the right thickness for
your work, you can get it thick
enough to be solid, use waterproof
fuses, with a little NI3 at the end
to make sure the stuff goes off with
a good boom, THIS IS A VERY STABLE
EXPLOSIVE, IT IS ALSO 3 TIMES MORE
POWERFUL THAN DYNAMITE.  A thin wire
with high voltage running through it
in the gel makes a good detonater too.

Post any of your "ANARCHISTIC TOOLS"
here, also, is there anything that
relates to anarchy that anyone would
like to see how it's done, or how to 
make it?  Just send mail to 25.

        HAVE FUN!!!!!!

   Have you ever heard of the 
millitary high power explosive, NI3?
It's 4 to 6 time MORE POWERFUL than 
dynamite, and, HERE'S HOW TO MAKE IT!

needed:

 IODINE CRYSTALS

AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE

Put the AH in a GLASS bowl, and 
disolve the Iodine in it, in a couple 
of minutes, new crystals will form, 
They are highly volitile, and illeagal
to have,For what ever it's worth.

      --PRESS RETURN TO CONTINUE--

Do not DROP, CRUSH, HEAT, or FUCK 
with them, take very extream 
percausions with them, pad them in an
air tight bottle.

ONE TEASPOON HAS THE IMPACT POWER OF
ONE M-100 FIRECRACKER.

Use them at your own risk! BUT HAVE 
FUN! MORE SOON! NEXT: LETTER BOMBS!

BLACK POWDER:GRANDPAS RECIPE
  TEXT BY,  EL PIRATA'
IF YA WANT TO MAKE SOME LOW 
EXPLOSIVE BOMBS THEN YOU PICKED THE 
RIGHT CHOICE!  FIRST OF ALL, THIS 
RECIPE WILL SHOW HOW TO MAKE BLACK 
POWDER IN A SIMPLE AND SAFE MANNER 
YET HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE SOME 
STRONG LOW EXPLOSIVE BOMBS.  

NOTE:  THE BELOW AMOUNTS WILL YIELD
TWO POUNDS (THAT'S 900 GRAMS FOR YOU 
METRIC USERS) OF BLACK POWDER.  
HOWEVER, ONLY THE RATIOS OF THE 
AMOUNTS OF INGREDIENTS ARE 
IMPORTANT.  THUS, FOR TWICE AS MUCH 
BLACK POWDER, DOUBLE ALL QUANTITIES 
USED.

MATERIAL REQUIRED
-----------------
LARGE WOODEN STICK

CLOTH, 2 FT. SQ.

FLAT WINDOW SCREENING, 1 FT. SQ.

HEAT SOURCE

WATER, 3 CUPS              

ALCOHOL, 5 PINTS (ANY KIND)

SULFER, POWDERED, 1/2 CUP (FLOWERS 
OF SULFER, AT A DRUG STORE)

WOOD CHARCOAL, POWDERED, 2 CUPS

POTASSIUM NITRATE, GRANULATD, 3 CUPS 
(SALTPETER, AT DRUG STORES)
2 BUCKETS, BOTH 2 GALLON, ONE MUST 
BE HEAT RESISTANT
.....................................
.....................................
PROCEDURE:                
----------
1.  PLACE ALCOHOL IN ONE OF THE 
BUCKETS.

2.  PLACE POTASSIUM NITRATE, 
CHARCOAL, AND SULFUR IN THE HEAT 
RESISTANT BUCKET.  ADD 1 CUP WATER 
AND MIX THOROUGHLY WITH WOODEN STICK 
UNTIL ALL INGREDIENTS ARE DISSOLVED.
                   
3.  ADD REMAINING WATER (2 CUPS) TO 
MIXTURE.  PLACE BUCKET ON HEAT 
SOURCE AND STIR UNTIL SMALL BUBBLES 
BEGIN TO FORM.

CAUTION:  DO NOT BOIL MIXTURE.  BE 
SURE ALL MIXTURE STAYS WET.  IF ANY 
IS DRY, AS ON SIDES OF PAN, IT MAY 
IGNITE.

4.  REMOVE BUCKET FROM HEAT AND POUR 
MIXTURE INTO ALCOHOL WHILE STIRRING 
VIGOROUSLY.

5.  LET ALCOHOL MIXTURE STAND ABOUT 
5 MINUTES.  STRAIN MIXTURE THROUGH 
CLOTH TO OBTAIN BLACK POWDER.  
DISCARD LIQUID.  WRAP CLOTH AROUND 
BLACK POWDER AND SQUEEZE TO REMOVE 
ALL EXCESS LIQUID.

6.  PLACE SCREENING OVER DRY BUCKET. 
 PLACE WORKABLE AMOUNT OF DAMP 
POWDER ON SCREEN AND GRANULATE BY 
RUBBING SOLID THROUGH SCREEN.

NOTE:  IF GRANULATED PARTICLES 
APPEAR TO STICK TOGETHER AND CHANGE 
SHAPE, RECOMBINE ENTIRE BATCH OF 
POWDER AND REPEAT STEPS 5 AND 6.

7.  SPREAD GRANULATED BLACK POWDER 
ON FLAT DRY SURFACE SO THAT LAYER 
ABOUT 1/2 INCH IS FORMED.  ALLOW TO 
DRY.  USE RADIATOR, OR DIRECT 
SUNLIGHT.  THIS SHOULD BE DRIED AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY IN ONE 
HOUR.  THE LONGER THE DRYING PERIOD, 
THE LESS EFFECTIVE THE BLACK POWDER.

CAUTION:  REMOVE FROM HEAT AS SOON 
AS GRANULES ARE DRY.  BLACK POWDER 
IS NOW READY FOR USE!

          There are many possibilities in the field of grenade manufacture,
       but for the most part, when you're dealing with grenades that must
       be constructed of easily available materials, the quality and the
       safety of the grenade is reduced dramatically.  Here I will deal
       with this problem, trying to produce a reasonable type of grenade
       that is relatively safe, can be stored and transported easily, but
       produces dramatic effects.  I strongly suggest that if you find it
       possible, you are far better off getting a REAL grenade than trying
       to produce one yourself, but you can be the judge.  As always, I
       want to note that this is all for educational purposes only, and I
       do not recommend anyone trying any of the following for real.

               The first thing you need is explosives.  If you can't get
       black powder, or gun powder, or make your own plastic explosives
       (we know there sure are enough text files floating around to explain
       how to make all of the above!) than you're really in a for making a
       grenade of this type.  You'll also need a coffee can, a smaller sized
       can (probably like an orange juice can, or V8), a coat hanger, and a
       fuse or fuze.  As for explosives, mercury fulminate is extremely good
       for this sort of thing.  Maybe I'll write a text file on its prepar-
       ation sometime.  But for now, you could probably get together a ton
       of firecrackers and take out the black powder (if you'r desperate)
       or get a couple quarter sticks from someone (or take a vacation in
       North Carolina).  The explosive goes in the juice can.  Don't pack
       it together too tight.  Loose black powder is better than compressed.
       This is the main explosive.  Cut up the coat hanger into little
       pieces approximately 1/2" long and fill up the coffee can until you
       can put the juice can in and the top of the juice can is level with
       the top of the coffee can.  If you don't have the time, and need to
       fill up the space faster, chuck in a couple small rocks or pieces of
       glass, and stuff like that until you have the bottom of the can filled.
       Now place the juice can in the coffee can, and center it.  Then fill
       the space around the coffee can with coat hanger stuff until the juice
       can is relatively stable.  Put a model rocket fuse in the explosive in
       the juice can.  Leave (at least) 3 1/2" to light from.  If necessary,
       secure the juice can or the explosive with some masking tape, ect...
       as long as it doesn't interfere with the action of the grenade.  Take
       the lid of the coffee can and cut a hole so that the fuse is exposed.
       You now have a fragmentation grenade.  It might be a good idea to
       practice with a football for a while before trying to destroy the
       neighbor's garage with it.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
 
Written by --------------------------> The Wave 
 
     This article deals with how to make counterfeit money.  Before reading 
this article it would be a very good idea to get a book about photo-offset 
printing, for that's how you'll have to print it.  For someone who is 
familiar with offset printing, printing money is a breeze.  Real money is made
by a process called gravure.  It involves carving out of a metal block (but I
don't think anyone can do that by hand-if you can, you should be on That's
Incredible!).  When you are done (if you did everything correctly) you will 
have a finished product nearly identical to real money, depending on your
printing skills.  Well, let's get started!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First I'd like to tell you briefly how offset printing works.  It starts
by making negatives (kind of like when you take a picture with your camera).
Then you take the negatives and put them on a piece of masking material (
usually orange).  Then you expose the STRIPPED negatives or FLATS to a  
lithographic plate with an arc light plate maker.  The BURNED plates are then
developed with the proper developer chemical.  These plates (one at a time of
course) are wrapped around the plate cylinder of the press.  The press to use
should be an 11 by 14 (or so) offset such as the 11 by 17 AB Dick 360.  Then
the printing begins!  To learn in detail how to do each of these steps you 
should again get a book on the subject.  The presswork takes some practice, 
but you'll get the hang of it.
 
     Ok, quit babbling on, Wave, and start the good stuff!  By the way you can
pick up an 11 by 14 offset for about $500 if you shop around (or you can 
** BORROW ** a press from your local Insty Prints at about 3:00 in the 
morning!).  First, like I said before, you need negatives.  Make 2 negatives
of the portrait side of the bill and 1 of the back side.  After developing
them and letting them dry, take them to a light table.  Get some opaque and,
on one of the portrait sides, touch out all the green (the seal and the serial
numbers).  Line that one up on the FLAT and leave about 1/2 inch from the top
of the flat.  Then for the other portrait, touch out everything BUT the seal 
and serial numbers.  The back side doesn't require any retouching because it
is all one color.  Now, make sure all the negatives are lined up right, or
REGISTERED, on the flats.  By the way, every time you need another serial 
number, just shoot 1 neg. of the portrait side and cut out the serial number.
Cut out the old serial number from the flat and replace it with the new one.
 
     Ok, now you have 3 flats, each represents a different color-black and 2
shades of green (which of course are made by mixing inks).  Now you are ready
to burn the plates.  Take a lithographic plate and mark 3 marks on it.  These
marks must be 2 & 9/16 in. apart, starting on one of the short edges.  Do the
same thing to 2 more plates.  Then take 1 of the flats and place it on the 
plate, lining the short edge up with the edge of the plate-EXACTLY!  Burn it,
move it up to the next mark, and cover up the exposed area you already burned.
Burn that and do the same thing 2 more times-moving the flat up one mark.  
Then do the same process with the other 2 flats (each on a separate plate).  
Develope all 3 plates.  You should have 4 images on each plate with an equal
space between each bill.  
 
                             Roll the Presses!
                             ---- --- -------
 
     The paper you will need won't match exactly, but you can make it pretty 
damn close (close enough for the cashier at K-Mart!).  The paper to use should
have a 25% rag content.  I have found that Disaperf computer paper works 
great - that's the kind that you can barely see the perforation.  Take this 
paper (cut the pinfeed holes off first!) and load it into the press.  Be sure
to set the air, buckle, and paper thickness right.  Start with the black plate
(the one with out the serial numbers).  Wrap it around the cylinder and load
black ink in.  Make sure you run more than you need because there will be a 
lot of rejects.  Then, while that's printing, mix the inks for the serial #'s
and the back side.  You'll need to add some white and maybe yellow to the 
serial # ink.  You need to add black to back side.  Experiment till you get
it right.  Clean the press and print the other side.  Now you have the bill
wioth no green seal or serial numbers.  Print a few with one serial number,
make another and repeat.  Keep doing this until you have as many different 
numbers as you want.  Then cut the bills to the exact size with a paper cutter
  Now you have a lot of money, except there is still one problemo - the paper
is pure white.  To dye it, mix the following in a pan: 2 cups hot water, 4
 
tea bags, and about 16-20 drops of green food coloring (experiment).  Dip
one of the bills in and compare it to a brand new REAL bill.  Make the neces-
sary adjustments, and dye all the bills.  Then it is a good idea to make them
look used.  Wrinkle them, rub coffee grinds on them, etc.  Congratulations!
You're rich!
 
 
     Some of the info was taken from The Poor Man's James Bond, but most from
personal knowledge.  Also, it would be a good idea to see the movie To Live 
and Die in L.A.  It is about a counterfeiter and they did a good job of show-
ing how to do it.  Well, that's all folks!

          PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS
          ------------------

              Commonly known as "zip" guns, guns made from pipe have
          been used for years by juvenile punks.  Today's Militants
          make them just for the hell of it or to shoot once in an
          assassination or riot and throw away if there is any danger
          of apprehension.

              They can be used many times but with some, a length of
          dowel is needed to force out the spent shell.

              There are many variations but the illustration shows the
          basic design.

              First, a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for
          the barrel to rest in.  The barrel is then taped securely to
          the stock with a good, strong tape.

              The trigger is made from galvanized tin.  A slot is
          punched in the trigger flap to hold a roofing, which is
          wired or soldered onto the flap. The trigger is bent and
          nailed to the stock on both sides.

              The pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas
          or water pipe with a bore that fits in a cartridge, yet
          keeps the cartridge rim from passing through the pipe.

              The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap, with a
          hole bored through it, is screwed on.  Then the trigger is
          slowly released to let the nail pass through the hole and
          rest on the primer.

              To fire, the trigger is pulled back with the left hand
          and held back with the thumb of the right hand.  The gun is
          then aimed and the thumb releases the trigger and the thing
          actually fires.

              Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in
          any hardware store.  All caliber bullets, from the .22 to
          the .45 are used in such guns.

              Some zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested
          within each other.  For instance, a .22 shell will fit
          snugly into a length of a car's copper gas line.
          Unfortunatey, the copper is too weak to withstand the
          pressure of the firing.  So the length of gas line is spread
          with glue and pushed into a wider length of pipe.  This is
          spread with glue and pushed into a length of steel pipe with
          threads and a cap.

              Using this method, you can accomodate any cartridge,
          even a rifle shell.  The first size of pipe for a rifle
          shell accomodates the bullet.  The second accomodates its
          wider powder chamber.

              A 12-gauge shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel
          pipe.  If you want to comply with the gun laws, the barrel
          should be at least eighteen inches long.

              Its firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol.
          It naturally has a longer stock and its handle is lengthened
          into a rifle butt.  Also, a small nail is driven half way
          into each side of the stock about four inches in the front of
          the trigger.  The rubber band is put over one nail and
          brought around the trigger and snagged over the other nail.

              In case you actually make a zip gun, you should test it
          before firing it by hand.  This is done by first tying the
          gun to a tree or post, pointed to where it will do no
          damage.  Then a string is tied to the trigger and you go off
          several yards.  The string is then pulled back and let go.
          If the barrel does not blow up, the gun is safe to fire by
          hand.

              You should not attempt to register such a gun.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Note: Information on the Astrolite Explosives were taken from the book     |
|       'Two Component High Explosive Mixtures' By Desert Pub'l              |
+=----------------------==/===%{ Disclaimer }%===\==------------------------+=
Some of the chemicals used are somewhat toxic, but who gives a fuck! Go ahead!
I won't even bother mentioning 'This information is for enlightening purposes
only'! I would love it if everyone made a gallon of astrolite and blew their
fucken school to kingdom scum!

Astrolite
---------

The astrolite family of liquid explosives were products of rocket propellant
research in the '60's. Astrolite A-1-5 is supposed to be the world's most
powerful non-nuclear explosive -at about 1.8 to 2 times more powerful than TNT.
Being more powerful it is also safer to handle than TNT (not that it isn't safe
in the first place) and Nitroglycerin.

Astrolite G
-----------

"Astrolite G is a clear liquid explosive especially designed to produce very
high detonation velocity, 8,600MPS (meters/sec.), compared with 7,700MPS for
nitroglycerin and 6,900MPS for TNT...In addition, a very unusual characteristic
is that it the liquid explosive has the ability to be absorbed easily into the
ground while remaining detonatable...In field tests, Astrolite G has remained
detonatable for 4 days in the ground, even when the soil was soaked due to
rainy weather" know what that means?....Astrolite Dynamite!

To make (mix in fairly large container & outside)
-------

Two parts by weight of ammonium nitrate mixed with one part by weight
'anhydrous' hydrazine, produces Astrolite G...Simple enough eh? I'm sure that
the 2:1 ratio is not perfect,and that if you screw around with it long enough,
that you'll find a better formula. Also, dunno why the book says 'anhydrous'
hydrazine, hydrazine is already anhydrous...

Hydrazine is the chemical you'll probably have the hardest time getting hold
of. Uses for Hydrazine are: Rocket fuel, agricultural chemicals (maleic hydra-
zide), drugs (antibacterial and antihypertension), polymerization catalyst,
plating metals on glass and plastics, solder fluxes, photographic developers,
diving equipment. Hydrazine is also the chemical you should be careful with.

Astrolite A/A-1-5
------------------

Ok, here's the good part...

Mix 20% (weight) aluminum powder to the ammonium nitrate, and then mix with
hydrazine. The aluminum powder should be 100 mesh or finer. Astrolite A has a
detonation velocity of 7,800MPS.

Misc. info
----------

You should be careful not to get any of the astrolite on you,if it happens
though, you should flush the area with water. Astrolite A&G both should be able
to be detonated by a #8 blasting cap.


Sodium Chlorate Formulas
------------------------

Sodium Chlorate is similar to potassium chlorate,and in most cases can be a
substitute. Sodium chlorate is also more soluble in water. You can find sodium
chlorate at Channel or any hardware/home improvement store. It is used in
blowtorches and you can get about 3lbs for about $6.00.

Sodium Chlorate Gunpowder
-------------------------

65% sodium chlorate
22% charcoal
13% sulfur
and sprinkle some graphite on top.

Rocket Fuel
-----------

6 parts sodium chlorate mixed *THOROUGHLY* with 5 parts rubber cement.

Rocket Fuel 2 (better performance)
----------------------------------

50% sodium chlorate
35% rubber cement ('One-Coat' (tm))
10% epoxy resin hardener
5%  sulfur

You may want to add more sodium chlorate depending on the purity you are using.

Incendiary Mixture
------------------

55% aluminum powder (atomized)
45% sodium chlorate
5%  sulfur

Impact Mixture
--------------

50% red phosphorus
50% sodium chlorate

Unlike potassium chlorate,sodium chlorate won't explode spontaneously when mix-
ed with phosphorus. It has to be hit to be detonated.

Filler explosive
----------------

85% sodium chlorate
10% vaseline
5% aluminum powder

Nitromethane formulas
---------------------

I thought that I might add this in since it's similar to Astrolite.

Nitromethane (CH3NO2)
specific gravity:1.139
flash point:95f
auto-ignite:785f

Derivation: reaction of methane or propane with nitric acid under pressure.

Uses: Rocket fuel; solvent for cellulosic compounds, polymers, waxes, fats,
      etc.
To be detonated with a #8 cap, add:

1) 95% nitromethane + 5% ethylenediamine
2) 94% nitromethane + 6% aniline

Power output: 22-24% more powerful than TNT. Detonation velocity of 6,200MPS.

Nitromethane 'solid' explosives
-------------------------------

2 parts nitromethane
5 parts ammonium nitrate (solid powder)

soak for 3-5 min. when done,store in an air-tight container.
This is supposed to be 30% more powerful than dynamite containing 60% nitro-
glycerin, and has 30% more brilliance.



A few questions:

1) Does anyone know how to make 'knockout gases'?
2) What's on the handkerchief you see people in the movies use to knockout
   people?
3) Does the formula for chloral hydrate in 'Poor Man's James Bond' work?
   Normally chloral hydrate is 1:5, chloral to water..but in PMJB it's 1:2.
   Also, what's the calcium oxide for?

ps- Kurt Saxon doesn't know shit about drugs!

Here's a GREAT little trick to play on your best fiend (no thats not a typo)
at skool, or maybe as a practial joke on a friend!

    Materials Needed
    ----------------

        1]   One Ball Point `Click` pen
        2]   Gun Powder
        3]   8 or 10 match heads
        4]   1 Match stick
        5]   a little sheet of sand paper (1 1/2" X 2")


      Procedure
      ---------

        1]   Unscrew pen and remove all parts but leave the button in the top
             in the pen.
        2]   Stick the match stick in the part of the pen clicker where the
             other little parts and the ink fill was.
        3]   Roll sand paper up and put around the match stick that is in the
             clicker.
        4]   Put the remaining Match Heads inside the pen, make sure that they
             are on the inside on the sand paper.
        5]   Put a small piece of paper or something in the other end of the
             pen where the ball point comes out.
        6]   Fill the end with the piece of paper in it with gun powder. The
             paper is to keep the powder from spilling.

The Finished pen should look like this:

   Small Paper Clog      Gun Powder         Matches & Sandpaper
       \                     |                   |
        \                    |                    |
         \  _________________|____________________|________
           <_______________________________|_______________|===
                                                            /
                                                 Clicker   /


     Planting The Device
     -------------------

        There are many ways to use this little device.  Here are a few of my
Favorite way to use this hendy little Anti-Personal-Device

     In School
     ---------

        1]   Replace it with a friends pen, it helps if it is the same color
             Style.  But if you get it there and he/she goes to write, watch
             the sparks fly!
        2]   You know how all these poor nigs are always asking you for a pen
             well this is the way to fix it! just give 'em this little pen and
             I gurantee they will neer ask you for another pen again.
        3]   Replace the teachers pen with it.

     In The Office
     -------------

        No Office experience, unless its the schools office, replace it with
        the principals or receptionist pens. They'll get a `bang` out of it!

Ahhh, I haven't written a file in quite a long time...  Being a Senior fuckin
cranks...  Party when ever you want, get laid by fresmen and sophmores,
its just generally fucking great...


Well, lately, there has been many Suicides lately.  A little while ago, here in
beautiful NJ, 4 teenagers said their last rites and started the car up in the
garage.  This brought a smile to my face, you see, the more people dead,
the better off you are in the game of life.   When people our age die, that
means the rest of us have a better chance of getting into the college we want,
cause there is less of them to compeate with.  There are more jobs to have, and
maybe you might find one you like.   There is more food and other material
products, and this keeps the price of everything down.  Its just better for
the whole society.   Who cares about the mourning family, they'll get over it,
as you know who says "another day, another death"...   Death is a fact of life
for everyone, and the more dead, the better.



HOW YOU CAN HELP:
-----------------


Find somebody that looks (as follows) like this:

-Real Ugly, someone who needs to be put out of misery, and so we don't have to
            look at them

-Real Quiet, these people usally have something wrong upstairs, they can't deal
             with other people, they are no good to you anyway.

-Real Stupid, everybody knows someone like this, like IQ of 98, someone who can
              be pursuaded easily into the act.

-Someone with parents that prod them, like high pressure parents, who tell 
         thier kids to do well in everything or die...

(this is the good one)

-Somebody who has tried committing suicide before, cause they are fucked up 
          allready and they are the easist to convince.



CONVINCING THEM:
----------------

Ok, find one of the above and try the first tactic, total harassment.  Just rag
and rag and rag and rag on them, tell them their mother sucks black cock in
hell, send letters saying that they are illegitimate, saying that they are 
drafted into the Marines..  Call them up and tell her mom that she does
Crack and she's pregnant.  Get a guy that looks like a total scumbag biker
with chains and shit and tell her mom that he's ready to pick her up  for
their orgy.   Or if its a guy tell him 'yo maun, i got de stuff, wheres de 
money??"... Just make their total life hell.

OR

Befriend them, get real close to them, tell them you love them, you want to
be with them forever (in hell).  Get close to the parents to, act real nice,
kiss some ass, be a real goody 2 shoes, feel like part of the family.
Then make up some crisis you supposedly had at home, say that your dad is
gonna kick you outa the house if (you dont cut that hair)...sorry...
                                  you dont get a job and pay for everything
you use.  Say that he grounded your for 5732 days and you can't go anywhere.
Then lie to the other kid's parents and tell them something like your
(son) daughter's is hooked on drugs and get her in trouble.  Then at
night tell the other party to meet you somewhere, like on a bridge, anywhere
that you can die easily.  Then make her feel like shit and ask (demand) her
to go in a suicide jump together, go 1-2-3, she jumps you stay where you
are and laugh.


PACTS:
------

Suicide Pacts are the best way to get rid of alot of people at once.  Pacts 
usally consist of 2 to 6 people, (unlike my good friend Jim Jones who wiped out
over 300 with poisoned Kool-Aid), and are usally done in a painless way.
Try to find a bunch of depressed people and tell them to join your little
group that meets twice a week to 'talk' about everyones problems.
Bullshit with them for a week or two, show a few other ways out of depression
(which should'nt work) then tell them (strongly) about a easy way out,
convince them into a SUICIDE PACT.  Probability is that if 2 or 3 agree with
it, the whole group will do it, and that's just dandy!.


PRE-ACT TACTICS:
----------------

Now since this person is never going to be around any more, and if you say
you are going with them, tell the other party to give you all their belongings
so you can 'give it to charity, someone who really needs it'.  Of course all
the goods go to bank account and some good blow.

Also, if you play your cards right, you can take out a life insurance policy
on the person and make 10g's to 1 mil, depending on the company and how
stupid they are.

Or if you forgot about the pre-act tactics just go to the parents and say
'She would want me to have this' (a $2500 pioneer stereo rack system),
a few weeks after the death, and cry when you do it.


WAYS OF SUICIDE:
----------------

The folling is a list of many ways to get the person to commit suicide:

-Carbon Monoxide, as in automobile exhaust, a very painless way to die.  You
just sit in the car, in a garage, and it feels like you are going to sleep.


-A Gun, also another painless way, point the gun at the temple (head), aim
on an angle towards the lower base of the skull, instant DEATH.


-Slitting of the Wrists, very stupid, painful at first, but eventually you go 
into shock.  This way of suicide has the highest failure rate due to people
chickening out, it lasts from 20 mins. to sometimes 3 hrs. not a good way.


-Jumping off a tall building, a good way, because %50 of the people that jump
DIE of fright before hitting the ground.  Somewhat tramatic for the 4 seconds
you are in the air, but more or less, a good way.


-Jumping in front of a Bus, Train, or any Large vehicle, a %75 percent success
rate as long as your head hits againt the oncoming force quickly.  People have
been mangled and lived through it, and you don't want that to happen, you
want to DIE REMEMBER??


-Overdose of Drugs, a somewhat lame way to go depending on the drug...
also you need to take the right amount due to if you take too much, you will
just throw it up and suffer for 24 hrs... not to much, not to little, you can 
determine by the recomened doseage.  Sleeping pills are probably the most 
painless, you just pass out.  Overdoses of drugs such as Acid,LSD,and other
phyco drug is another stupid way to go, and if you live through it you are
a vegetable for the rest of your fucking life.  


Drowning- A bad way to go, due to suffication people who have lived through
a near drowing say "It fucking sucks" to put it in laymens terms, not
suggested.


Hanging- good if you do it right.  In the old west they used a more or less
'painless' way of hanging.  When they released the lever, your neck broke and
usally you couldnt feel anything anyway, and before you knew it, you we DEAD.
A relitivly good and graphic way to go.


Running your car off a cliff- Very stupid unless you have a high cliff or
mountain.  People usally try to pull out at the last second, and end up
paralized for life.  Not recommended.


Electricution- Not bad, as long you have a good current.  Go to your local 
power substation and ground yourself to something, and as soon as you touch
the ends of those big semi-condutors, you're history.



Poison- Same as drugs.


Stabbing yourself- Usally reserved for Sickos, a very painful way to die, and
you watch yourself bleed to death.  Pretty beat way to go.


Drinking yourself to Death-Sounds fun, should try it sometime....but seriously,
probably not a bad way to go, get wasted, and die!  Get grain alcohol, 
199 proof, good shit.


Well, im probably missing like hundreds of more ways, but this file is
just to get you started in the game of life.  Good luck, and keep track
of your results.

                        A DEAD CAT WHISKER PRODUCTION


                   HOW TO BLOW UP A CAR:  A different way

                           by  THE FLYING HERMIT
..............................................................................
______________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________



     There are times in a man's life when he gets mad at someone.  And then
 there are times when he gets REAL mad at someone.  These are the times for
 vengence.  And what better way to get back at someone than damaging his/her
 car.  The thing which s/he has saved up for, worked hard for, and paid for.
 Yes!!!  This is the item which you must attack, for most of the time, it is
 parked outside, easily accesible at night and very important to the asshole
 you want to annoy.  The method I will describe is relatively easy and safe to
 set up, but very effective in causing damage.  The method of destruction will
 be explosion.  The explosive device is already inside the car, factory
 installed just for you to use.  It is the standard 12 volt car battery.

Let's look at the princleple behind the exploding battery:

you are by now familiar with the theory of how batteries work, and if you
aren't, your probably too young to be thinking of these sorts of things.
Anyway, within the battery, is not only a current flowing from positive to
negative (actually, it is from negative to positive, but that's another
story), but also a small internal resistance.  The resistance inside the
battery is in the order of magnitude of roughly .0024 OHM, an amount so small,
it is usually ignored.  But, that is for normal operation of the battery.  The
case we're interrested in is for the closed circuit of the battery by itself.
For a closed circuit, the internal resistance becomes a big deal, and the
following holds true:


     (voltage) divided by (resistance) equals (current)
  
                          or
 
                        V/R=I

let's calculate

              12volt/.0024 ohm  =   5000 amps

Amazing!!!!!  by causing a short circuit (closed circuit), the battery produces
5000 amps of current running through that little bugger.  However, this
current is short lived, and the battery cannot handle this capacity for long,
so therefore the battery explodes.  It explodes with a rather large force,
causing considerable damage from the pressure, flames, and hurling lead.  All
these goodies combined with the volatile liquids hidden inside the engine will
cause the vehicle to add another member to the big junk yard in the sky.

Great!!  now we know how to make the car blow up, but we don't want to go up
with hte car, so what we need is a triggering device.  one can go from the
simple to elaborate, by incorporating sophisticated devices such as radio
transmitters, but for our purposes, we will opt for a simple timer and relay
device.

First, we will need some heavy cable, capable of handling the massive current
without melting, then we will need a relay also able to cope with large
currents.  Next, we need a timer which will count down the seconds to our
triuphant vengance.  And finally, a small battery to run the relay (the
small battery will run both the relay and the timer if you are using a digital
timer).

Now: Connect the small battery to the timer, the timer to the relay, and the
relay to the car battery. Connect the heavy duty relay to the the car battery
with the heavy cable.  There you have it!!!!



                                               __________________
      small batt                              /    ____         _|

   |____________/    |_____|          \_______/



remember,  tinkering with other people's property is a no-no, and officer
friendly might get ugly with you if he sees you doing this, so be forewarned.
Also, car batteries are dangerous to play with, and if handled improperly,
may explode unintentionally, causing the concentrated acid to spray in your
face, making you look like the elephant man.   so don't come crying to me when
something happens, cause i'll just laugh at you and possibly urinate over you
if you rub me the wrong way.

        PIPE BOMB
     Danger Explosives
     \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\




HOW TO MAKE A REALLY NICE PIPE BOMB
OUT OF EVERYDAY MATERIALS.

1) GO TO YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND
TELL THE GUY THAT IS HELPING YOU
THAT YOU WANT A PIECE OF STEEL PIPE
ONE FOOT LONG. AND ALSO THAT YOU WANT
THE ENDS THREADED AND YOU ALSO WANT
CAPS TO PUT ON THE END.

2) NOW GET AHOLD OF A BABYFOOD JAR.
MAKE SURE THAT THE JAR WILL FIT DOWN
THE PIPE REAL EASY LIKE. FILL THE
BABYJAR WITH EVERYDAY VINEGAR. MAKE
SURE THE TOP IS SCREWED ON REAL TIGHT.
**IF IT IS LOOSE YOU WILL BLOW YOUR
HAND OFF**

3)NOW CAP ONE END OF YOUR PIPE WITH
ONE OF THE CAPS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
PICKED UP WITH THE PIPE. IF YOU KNOW
OF SOMEONE WITH A WIELDER, HAVE HIM
WIELD A BEAD AROUND THE THREADS AFTER
YOU HAVE IT CAPPED.

4)PUT SOME SMALL SHARP ROCKS DOWN THE
END OF THE PIPE AND THEN SLIDE THE
BABYJAR DOWN INSIDE SO THE GLASS END
IS AGAINST THE LITTLE ROCKS. NOW
EMPTY A MEDIUM BOX OF ARM AND HAMMER
BAKING SODA INTO THE PIPE. CAP THE
OTHER END OF THE PIPE AND IF YOU
CAN WIELD IT, THEN GO FOR IT.
**BE FUCKING CAREFUL** YOU MIGHT
BREAK THE JAR INSIDE AND YOU WON'T
KNOW THAT YOU BROKE IT UNTIL YOU 
SEE YOUR HAND FLY OFF!!!

5)NOW, WHEN YOU WANT TO BLOW SOMETHING
UP, JUST SMACK THE END OF THE PIPE 
THAT SENDS THE JAR INSIDE DOWN AGAINST
THE SMALL ROCKS. OH YEAH, SMACK IT
AGAINST SOME CONCREAT. THIS BREAKS
THE JAR AND THE VINEGAR AND BAKING
SODA MIX TOGETHER AND BUILDS UP
PRESSURE. WHEN IT GETS TO THE 
CRITICAL POINT....WHAMMY!!!!

******IMPORTANT******

AFTER YOU HIT THE PIPE AGAINST THE
GROUND, GET THE HELL RID OF IT!!!
TOSS IT INTO SOMEONES CAR OR SOMEWHERE.
SOMETIMES. IT TAKES FIVE MINUTS FOR
IT TO GO OFF. SOMETIMES TWO.
BUT IT WILL GO OFF! TRUST ME!

I DID THIS WHEN I WAS LIVING IN
ARIZONA. MY FREIND THAT TAUGHT ME
THIS WAS A DEMOLITIONS EXPERT FOR 
THE NAVY.

THE FIRST TIME I DID IT. WE TOSSED

                How to make a Milk Carton Bomb

 A milk carton bomb is relitively simple and safe.  It's only purpose it to create a loud noise.  

 The ingredients needed to make this are few and easy to aquire.   You will need a plastic milk carton, lighter fluid(type used in cigarette lighters), a piece of paper, and a pair of chopsticks.  If you can not obtain chop sticks, it's okay to substitut
e
 them with something that can hold the paper and is long enough so that you won't be harmed by the flames.

 After aquiring all of the ingredients, you can now start to make the bomb.  The procedure is easy.  First, puncture a hole at the bottom of the milk carton with a screw driver or equivalent.  Next fill one-fourth of the milk carton with lighter fluid.  
P
lace the milk carton in a fairly large area outisde.  Hold a piece of paper between the chopsticks and light the paper with a match.  Cautiously place the lighted paper under the hole of the carton and BOOM!  You have your loud explosion with little dama
g
e to the surrounding area.  It would be a good idea to have some water handy to extinguish any flames.  

 Be careful when doing this and have fun.

STUFF YOU'LL NEED:
------------------

AN 8 INCH SECTION OF PVC CONDUIT 1" IN
DIAMETER
2 PIPE CAPS (THAT WILL FIT THE PVC)
SOME SORT OF PROPELLANT
SOME GREEN WATERPROOF FUSE
A TUBE OF FORMA-GASKET, OR SOME SORT OF
SEALANT
A HOT GLUE GUN
A DRILL WITH A SMALL BIT

ASSEMBLY:
---------

PUT ONE OF THE CAPS ON THE PVC, SEAL
IT, AND LET IT DRY.
FILL THE PIPE HALFWAY FULL WITH YOUR
PROPELLANT
HOLD ONE END OF THE FUSE WHILE FILLING
THE PIPE THE REST OF THE WAY WITH THE
PROPELLANT.
THE PIPE SHOULD NOW BE FULL OF THE
PROPELLANT UP TO 1/3 INCH FROM THE TOP
OF THE PVC. FILL IT THE REST OF THE WAY
WITH HOT GLUE, AND LET IT COOL.
DRILL A SMALL HOL IN THE REMAINING PIPE
CAP, AND PUT IT ON THE PVC
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE RUN THE FUSE THROUGH
THE SMALL HOLE!
NOW, SEAL THE CAP ON THE PIPE, AND SEAL
THE SMALL HOLE AROUND THE FUSE HOLE.

YOU NOW HAVE A WORKING PIPE BOMB WHICH
IS ROUGHLY THE EQUIVALENT OF 1 STICK OF
TNT. HOW YOU USE IT IS UP TO YOU.

THIS FILE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES
ONLY. I AM IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ANYTHING YOU DO WITH A PIPE BOMB.
YOU'RE YOUR OWN PERSON, SO IF YOU GO
BLOW THE HELL OUT OF SOME FACIST PIG, I
AM NOT RESPONSIBLE. (ALTHOUGH I'LL BE
GLAD YOU DID IT)

THIS WILL BE A SERIES WRITTEN EVERY SO OFTEN TO INFORM YOU FUTURE NINJAS OR
KILLERS OUT THERE.  I WILL WRITE A SERIES OF PHILES ON THE SECRETS OF THE
NINJA.  THIS IS NO BULLSHIT YOU SEE IN THE BOOKS IN YOUR LOCAL MARTIAL ARTS
STORE.  THIS IS THE REAL SHIT.  DON'T ABUSE YOUR POWERS.
 
***WARNING***
IF YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS IN ANY OF THE SERIES AND YOU DO HARM SOMEONE BAD
I WILL TAKE NO BLAME FOR IT.  PLEASE DON'T INTEND TO USE THESE TRICKS AS A
CHILDISH JOKE.  SOME OF THE THINGS I MIGHT WRITE MAY BE VERY HARMFUL...MOST
LIKELY DEADLY.
 
 
BACKGROUND
----------
I WAS BORN IN JAPAN, RAISED AND TAUGHT THE ART OF NINJUTSU FROM MY FAMILY.
I IMMIGRATED TO THE U.S. AND BECAME A U.S. CITIZEN.  I'VE BEEN STUDYING
THE ART FOR OVER 15 YEARS NOW.  I AM REVEALING SOME OF THE SECRETS TO YOU
SINCE MANY PEOPLE ARE WRITING BULLSHIT TO PLEASE THE KIDS, AND ALL THAT
BULL MAKES ME MAD.  IT SEEMS LIKE THE BOOKS CAN SOMETIMES DEGRADE US, THE
PRESENT NINJAS.
 
POISON
------
THERE WERE MANY TYPES OF POISON USED IN THE OLD DAYS IN JAPAN.  MOST OF THE
POISON WAS MADE AT HOME WITH PLANTS, HERBS, AND OTHER INGREDIENTS OBTAINABLE
VERY EASILY.  IN THIS SERIES I WILL DISCUSS A CERTAIN TYPE OF POISON WHICH
HAS A DELAYING DEATH EFFECT.
 
WARNING
-------
THIS POISON IS DEADLY.  I KNOW SOMEONE IN MY CLAN WHO HAS USED THIS TYPE OF
POISON TO KILL A PHEW PEOPLE.  IT WORKED FOR A WHILE BUT EVENTUALLY HE WAS
CAUGHT.  HE IS IN JAIL FOR A LIFE SENTENCE FOR MURDER.
 
========
 POISON
========
 
THIS POISON WILL KILL THE AFFECTED VICTIM WITHIN A WEEK.  THE REASON FOR THE
TIME DELAY IS THAT THE POISON CAUSES THE VICTIM TO GET TETANUS.  THIS PROCESS
CAN BE FATAL, SO PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL IN USING THIS POISON.
 
THE POISON IS FAIRLY SIMPLE TO MAKE.  USING IT TO KILL SOMEONE IS SOMEWHAT
COMPLICATING.
 
THIS IS AN INFECTIOUS POISON SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVEN'T ANY CUTS ON YOUR HANDS
WHEN PREPARING THE POISON.
 
INGREDIENTS:
  HORSE SHIT (EXTRACTED)
  HUMAN BLOOD (TYPE DEPENDS ON VICTIM)
 
YOU CAN GET HORSE SHIT FROM MOST ANYWHERE NOWADAYS SINCE THERE ARE COPS WITH
HORSES NOWADAYS.  JUST WALK AROUND WHERE YOU KNOW HORSES PASS BY, AND GET A
SMALL QUANTITY OF HORSE SHIT.  DON'T GET A LOT CAUSE THAT SHIT STINKS.
 
TAKE SOME HORSE SHIT PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE AND PUT A RUBBER STOPPER ON TOP.
ONCE YOU OBTAIN THE HORSE SHIT, YOU MUST EXTRACT THE NECESSARY PART OF THE
SHIT.
 
YOU MUST REMOVE ALL THE HAY AND OTHER GARBAGE IN THE HORSE SHIT.  YOU CAN
REMOVE THE RUBBER STOPPER AND HEAT THE SHIT OVER A LIGHT FLAME.  THE SHIT
SHOULD START TO MELT AND THE JUNK IS EXTRACTED OUT OF THE SHIT.
 
WHEN THE SHIT MELTS, DUMP IT ON SOME KIND OF FILTERING SYSTEM SO YOU CAN
REMOVE THE JUNK.  REPEAT THE PROCESS UNTIL MOST, IF POSSIBLE, ALL OF THE
JUNK IS REMOVED.  !!! CAUTION !!! THIS PROCESS STINKS UP THE WHOLE FUCKING
HOUSE SO DO IT OUT SIDE.
 
WHEN THE SHIT IS EXTRACTED, YOU MUST OBTAIN THE HUMAN BLOOD.  THE TYPE OF
BLOOD IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!
 
FOR EXAMPLE...IF YOU WANT TO KILL THE VICTIM, YOU MUST USE THE BLOOD TYPE
WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE VICTIM: BLOOD TYPE A POS. NEEDS AN A POS. BLOOD IN
THE POISON, AND SO FORTH.
 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE INTENDED VICTIMS BLOOD TYPE IS, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN USE OTHER BLOOD TYPES AND MIX THEM LIKE TRANSFUSIONS OF BLOOD.  BUT
THE EFFECT OF THE POISON MAY BE DELAYED OR IT MAY NOT BE FATAL.  BUT IT
SHOULD DO THE TRICK.
 
GET THE EXTRACTED HORSE SHIT AND MIX THE SHIT WITH THE BLOOD.  THE PROPORTION
OF THE BLOOD WITH RESPECT TO THE SHIT IS 3 TO 1, WHICH MEANS FOR EVERY 1 OZ.
OF SHIT, THERE MUST BE 3 OZ. OF BLOOD, AND SO FORTH.
 
HEAT THE MIXTURE AT A VERY LOW HEAT, AND THE MIXTURE SHOULD START BUBBLING.
TRY NOT TO INHALE THE SMELL.  IT'S KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER IF YOU SMELL IT.
DO NOT HEAT IT WITH A HIGH FLAME, SINCE THE BACTERIA IN THE SHIT AND THE
BLOOD WILL DIE AND THE POISON WILL BECOME USELESS.
 
HEAT THE TEST TUBE AND STIR THE CONTENT WHILE HEATING TO CREATE A BETTER
MIXTURE.  WHEN THE CONTENT STARTS TO CHANGE COLORS FROM RED TO BRICK BROWN OR
REDDISH-BROWN, THEN REMOVE THE MIXTURE FROM THE FLAME.  ALLOW THE POISON TO
COOL OFF.
 
WHEN THE POISON COOLS OFF, THEN YOU'VE JUST MADE ONE OF THE DEADLIEST POISONS
AROUND.
 
THIS IS NOT A TYPE OF POISON WHICH YOU CAN JUST SPILL ON THE VICTIM, NOR IS
IT ONE THAT YOU CAN JUST PUT INTO SOMEONES FOOD.  IT HAS TO ENTER THE VICTIM'S
BLOOD STREAMS.  TO DO THAT YOU MUST USE A NEEDLE OR A KNIFE TO RUPTURE THE
SKIN IN SOME WAY IN ORDER FOR THE POISON TO WORK.
 
THE NINJA IN THE OLDEN DAYS USED WHAT WAS CALLED FUKIYA AND FUKIBARI.  THE
FUKIYA IS A BLOWGUN MADE OF BAMBOO AND THE FUKIBARI WAS THE DART BLOWN OUT
OF THE BLOWGUN.  WE DIPPED THE DARTS IN THIS POISON, THEN BLEW THE DART OUT
OF THE GUN IMMEDIATELY.  WE USUALLY STRUCK THE VICTIM AT PRESSURE POINTS
WHICH MADE THE VICTIM PASS OUT.  WHEN THE VICTIM PASSED OUT, WE REMOVED THE
DART AND LEFT THE SCENE.  THE PERSON AWAKENS WITH TETANUS, AND DIES WITHIN A
PHEW DAYS, NO LONGER THAN A WEEK.  ANOTHER MURDER WITHOUT A TRACE.
 
WHAT CAN BE DONE IN MODERN TIMES IS GET A NEEDLE DIPPED WITH THE STUFF AND
JUST POKE THE VICTIM.  MOST LIKELY THE VICTIM THINKS YOUR CRAZY AND CONTINUE
TO FIGHT YOU.  IF THE POISON ENTERED HIS BLOOD STREAM, HE WILL GET TETANUS.
WHEN AND IF HE FINDS OUT THAT HE HAS TETANUS, AND GETS A PENICILLIN SHOT OR
SOMETHING, HE WILL LIVE.  BUT IF HE FINDS OUT TOO LATE OR DOESN'T FIND OUT
AT ALL, HE WILL DIE.
 
THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS OF GETTING THE POISON INTO THE VICTIM'S BLOOD
STREAM.  YOU WANTING TO BECOME THE TRUE NINJA CAN TRY MANY WAYS TO KILL
WITHOUT A TRACE.  I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER USE IT AS A JOKE.  BE VERY CAREFUL
NOT TO GET THE POISON INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM.
 
GOOD LUCK AND HAVE A NICE DAY.
 
DATED: 01-05-1985
 
 
PLEASE DO NOT ALTER THIS PHILE IN ANY WAY.  I WANT THIS PHILE TO BE COMPLETE
AND STAY COMPLETE AS IT IS OFFERED TO MANY PEOPLE.  YOU MAY SHARE THIS PHILE
WITH ANYONE AND EVERYONE.  BUT THE BEST WAY IS TO KEEP THE SECRETS WITHIN
YOURSELF.

ROGER,
      I CALLED HAYA YESTERDAY AND TALKED WITH HER ABOUT HER INJURY.  SHE SAYS
SHE WAS IN HER HEALTH CLUB TRYING TO DO SOME NEW EXERCISE RECOMMENDED BY HER
THERAPIST.  SOMETHING WENT AFOUL AND SHE PULLED SOME MUSCLE. IN HER LOWER BACK.
 SHE HAS BEEN OFF WORK FOR A WEEK USING HER TIME DUE, AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO
PRESENT ANY JOB-RELATED PROBLEMS.  SHE MAY STOP BY AFTER CLASS FRIDAY IF WE GO
TO LA VILLA, OR WILL TRY TO MAKE THE THAI TRIP NEXT FRIDAY.  SHE DID SAY THAT
IF YOU WANTED TO COME OVER AND EXERCISE HER LOWER BACK, SHE WOULD TICKLE YOUR
EARS WITH HER BIG TOES.  (AND NO NEED TO WRAP YOUR PACKAGE)  EXPLAIN THAT ONE
TO LINDA (WOULD SHE ACCEPT IT LIKE SHE DID WHEN YOU SCREWED RACQUEL WELCH OR
SEKA?
